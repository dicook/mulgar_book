# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This file contains what you need to know to help. 

If you have a __contribution__, please fork the repo and make a pull request (PR). If these terms are unfamiliar to you, take a look at [_Happy Git and GitHub for the useR_](https://happygitwithr.com/). It might be helpful to start a GitHub issue to discuss them before putting a lot of effort into it. 

If you make significant changes, include the phrase "I assign the copyright of this contribution to the authors listed in the `DESCRIPTION` file".

__If you find a bug__, please make an issue or pull request. Since all of the data and code are available, we will require minimal reprex (reproducible example). The goal of a reprex is to make it as easy as possible for me to recreate your problem so that we can fix it. If you've never heard of a reprex before, start by reading "[What is a reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex#what-is-a-reprex)", and follow the advice further down that page. 

# Formatting
