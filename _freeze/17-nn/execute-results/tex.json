These transformed combinations are added recursively to yield class predictions. They are considered to be black box models, but there is a growing demand for interpretability. Although interpretability is possible, it can be unappealing to understand a complex model constructed to tackle a difficult classification task. Nevertheless, this is the motivation for the explanation of visualisation for NN models in this chapter. \n\nIn the simplest form, we might write the equation for a NN as\n\n$$\n\\hat{y} = f(x) = a_0+\\sum_{h=1}^{s}\nw_{0h}\\phi(a_h+\\sum_{i=1}^{p} w_{ih}x_i)\n$$\nwhere $s$ indicates the number of nodes in the hidden (middle layer), and $\\phi$ is a choice of activation function. In a simple situation where $p=3$, $s=2$, and linear output layer, the model could be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\hat{y} = a_0+ & w_{01}\\phi(a_1+w_{11}x_1+w_{21}x_2+w_{31}x_3) +\\\\\n & w_{02}\\phi(a_2+w_{12}x_1+w_{22}x_2+w_{32}x_3)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\nwhich is a combination of two (linear) models, each of which could be examined for their role in making predictions. \n\nIn practice, a model may have many nodes, and several hidden layers, a variety of activation functions, and regularisation modifications. One should keep in mind the principle of parsimony is important when applying NNs, because it is tempting to make an overly complex, and thus over-parameterised, construction.  Fitting NNs is still problematic. One would hope that fitting produces a stable result, whatever the starting seed the same parameter estimates are returned. However, this is not the case, and different, sometimes radically different, results are routinely obtained after each attempted fit [@wickham2015]. \n\nFor these examples we use the software `keras` [@keras] following the installation and tutorial details at [https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/](https://tensorflow.rstudio.com/tutorials/). Because it is an interface to python it can be tricky to install. If this is a problem, the example code should be possible to convert to use `nnet` [@VR02] or `neuralnet` [@neuralnet]. We will use the penguins data to illustrate the fitting, because it makes it easier to understand the procedures and the fit. However, a NN is like using a jackhammer instead of a trowel to plant a seedling, more complicated than necessary to build a good classification model for this data.\n\n## Setting up the model \n\\index{classification!ANN architecture}\n\nA first step is to decide how many nodes the NN architecture should have, and what activation function should be used. To make these decisions, ideally you already have some knowledge of the shapes of class clusters. For the penguins classification, we have seen that it contains three elliptically shaped clusters of roughly the same size. This suggests two nodes in the hidden layer would be sufficient to separate three clusters (@fig-nn-diagram). Because the shapes of the clusters are convex, using linear activation (\"relu\") will also be sufficient. The model specification is as follows:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(keras)\ntensorflow::set_random_seed(211)\n\n# Define model\np_nn_model <- keras_model_sequential()\np_nn_model %>% \n  layer_dense(units = 2, activation = 'relu', \n              input_shape = 4) %>% \n  layer_dense(units = 3, activation = 'softmax')\np_nn_model %>% summary\n\nloss_fn <- loss_sparse_categorical_crossentropy(\n  from_logits = TRUE)\n\np_nn_model %>% compile(\n  optimizer = \"adam\",\n  loss      = loss_fn,\n  metrics   = c('accuracy')\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that `tensorflow::set_random_seed(211)` sets the seed for the model fitting so that we can obtain the same result to discuss later. It needs to be set before the model is defined in the code. The model will also be saved in order to diagnose and make predictions. \n\n![Network architecture for the model on the penguins data.

The model specified for the penguins data with only two nodes is unlikely to be overfitted, but it is nevertheless good practice to use a training set for building and a test set for evaluation. \n\n@fig-p-split-pdf shows the tour being used to examine the split into training and test samples for the penguins data. Using random sampling, particularly stratified by group, should result the two sets being very similar, as can be seen here. It does happen that several observations in the test set are on the extremes of their class cluster, so it could be that the model makes errors in the neighbourhoods of these points.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {#fig-p-split-html layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Grand tour](gifs/p_split.gif){#fig-split-grand fig-alt=\"FIX ME\" width=300}\n\n![Guided tour](gifs/p_split_guided.gif){#fig-split-guided fig-alt=\"FIX ME\" width=300}\n\nEvaluating the training/test split, where we expect that the two samples should roughly match.

The explanatory variables need to be provided as a `matrix`, and the categorical response needs to be separate, and specified as a `numeric` variable, beginning with 0. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Data needs to be matrix, and response needs to be numeric\np_train_x <- p_train %>%\n  select(bl:bm) %>%\n  as.matrix()\np_train_y <- p_train %>% pull(species) %>% as.numeric() \np_train_y <- p_train_y-1 # Needs to be 0, 1, 2\np_test_x <- p_test %>%\n  select(bl:bm) %>%\n  as.matrix()\np_test_y <- p_test %>% pull(species) %>% as.numeric() \np_test_y <- p_test_y-1 # Needs to be 0, 1, 2\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nThe specified model is reasonably simple, four input variables, two nodes in the hidden layer and a three column binary matrix for output. This corresponds to 5+5+3+3+3=19 parameters. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nModel: \"sequential\"\n______________________________________________________________\n Layer (type)              Output Shape             Param #   \n==============================================================\n dense_1 (Dense)           (None, 2)                10        \n dense (Dense)             (None, 3)                9         \n==============================================================\nTotal params: 19 (76.00 Byte)\nTrainable params: 19 (76.00 Byte)\nNon-trainable params: 0 (0.00 Byte)\n______________________________________________________________\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Fit model\np_nn_fit <- p_nn_model %>% keras::fit(\n  x = p_train_x, \n  y = p_train_y,\n  epochs = 200,\n  verbose = 0\n)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nBecause we set the random number seed we will get the same fit each time the code provided here is run. However, if the model is re-fit without setting the seed, you will see that there is a surprising amount of variability in the fits. Setting `epochs = 200` helps to usually get a good fit. One expects that `keras` is reasonably stable so one would not expect the huge array of fits as observed in @wickham2015 using `nnet`. That this can happen with the simple model used here reinforces the notion that fitting of NN models is fiddly, and great care needs to be taken to validate and diagnose the fit. \n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: info\nFitting NN models is fiddly, and very different fitted models can result from restarts, parameter choices, and architecture. \n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\\infobox{Fitting NN models is fiddly, and very different fitted models can result from restarts, parameter choices, and architecture.  \n}\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe fitted model that we have chosen as the final one has reasonably small loss and high accuracy.

Although it's rarely easy, most software will allow the coefficients for the models at these nodes to be extracted. With the penguins NN model there are two nodes, so we can extract the coefficients and plot the resulting two linear combinations to examine the separation between classes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract hidden layer model weights\np_nn_wgts <- keras::get_weights(p_nn_model, trainable=TRUE)\np_nn_wgts \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[[1]]\n           [,1]        [,2]\n[1,]  0.6216676  1.33304155\n[2,]  0.1851478 -0.01596385\n[3,] -0.1680396 -0.30432791\n[4,] -0.8867414 -0.36627045\n\n[[2]]\n[1]  0.12708087 -0.09466381\n\n[[3]]\n           [,1]     [,2]       [,3]\n[1,] -0.1646167 1.527644 -1.9215064\n[2,] -0.7547278 1.555889  0.3210194\n\n[[4]]\n[1]  0.4554813 -0.9371488  0.3577386\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThe linear coefficients for the first node in the model are 0.62, 0.19, -0.17, -0.89, and the second node in the model are 1.33, -0.02, -0.3, -0.37. We can use these like we used the linear discriminants in LDA to make a 2D view of the data, where the model is separating the three species. The constants 0.13, -0.09 are not important for this. They are only useful for drawing the location of the boundaries between classes produced by the model.\n\nThese two sets of model coefficients provide linear combinations of the original variables. Together, they define a plane on which the data is projected to view the classification produced by the model. Ideally, though this plane should be defined using an orthonormal basis otherwise the shape of the data distribution might be warped. So we orthonormalise this matrix before computing the data projection.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Orthonormalise the weights to make 2D projection\np_nn_wgts_on <- tourr::orthonormalise(p_nn_wgts[[1]])\np_nn_wgts_on\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           [,1]       [,2]\n[1,]  0.5593355  0.7969849\n[2,]  0.1665838 -0.2145664\n[3,] -0.1511909 -0.1541475\n[4,] -0.7978314  0.5431528\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Plot of the data in the linear combinations from the two nodes in the hidden layer.

Training and test sets are indicated by empty and solid circles. The three species are clearly different but there is some overlap or confusion for a few penguins. The most interesting aspect to learn is that there is no big gap between the Gentoo and other species, which we know exists in the data. The model has not found this gap, and thus is likely to unfortunately and erroneously confuse some Gentoo penguins, particularly with Adelie.\n\nWhat we have shown here is a process to use the models at the nodes of the hidden layer to produce a reduced dimensional space where the classes are best separated, at least as determined by the model. The process will work in higher dimensions also. \n\nWhen there are more nodes in the hidden layer than the number of original variables it means that the space is extended to achieve useful classifications that need more complicated non-linear boundaries. The extra nodes describe the non-linearity. @wickham2015 provides a good illustration of this in 2D. The process of examining each of the node models can be useful for understanding this non-linear separation, also in high dimensions.\n\n## Examining predictive probabilities\n\\index{classification!predictive probabilities}\n\nWhen the predictive probabilities are returned by a model, as is done by this NN, we can use a ternary diagram for three class problems, or high-dimensional simplex when there are more classes to examine the strength of the classification.

A good resource for learning about the range of methods is @iml. Local explanations provide some information about variables that are important for making the prediction for a particular observation.

It is an average, computed from the change in prediction when all combinations of presence or absence of other variables. In the computation, for each combination, the prediction is computed by substituting absent variables with their average value, like one might do when imputing missing values. \n\n@fig-shapley-pcp shows the Shapley values for Gentoo observations (both training and test sets) in the penguins data, as a parallel coordinate plot. The values for the single misclassified Gentoo penguin (in the training set) is coloured orange. Overall, the Shapley values don't vary much on `bl`, `bd` and `fl` but they do on `bm`. The effect of other variables is seems to be only important for `bm`. \n\nFor the misclassified penguin, the effect of `bm` for all combinations of other variables leads to a decline in predicted value, thus less confidence in it being a Gentoo. In contrast, for this same penguin when considering the effect of `bl` the predicted value increases on average. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![SHAP values focused on Gentoo class, for each variable.

We also note that a similar investigation was presented in @li2020visualizing, with a focus on investigating the model at different epochs during the training.\n\\index{data!fashion MNIST}\n\nThe first step is to download and prepare the data.

This simplifies the analysis, and in general we do not need the original pixel or hidden node information for the interpretation here. The comparison is using the test-subset of the data.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# get the fitted model\nmodel_fashion_mnist <- load_model_tf(\"data/fashion_nn\")\n# observed response labels in the test set\ntest_tags <- factor(class_names[test_labels + 1],\n                    levels = class_names)\n\n# calculate activation for the hidden layer, this can be done\n# within the keras framework\nactivations_model_fashion <- keras_model(\n  inputs = model_fashion_mnist$input,\n  outputs = model_fashion_mnist$layers[[2]]$output\n)\nactivations_fashion <- predict(\n  activations_model_fashion,\n  test_images, verbose = 0)\n\n# PCA for activations\nactivations_pca <- prcomp(activations_fashion)\nactivations_pc <- as.data.frame(activations_pca$x)\n\n# PCA on the original data\n# we first need to flatten the image input\ntest_images_flat <- test_images\ndim(test_images_flat) <- c(nrow(test_images_flat), 784)\nimages_pca <- prcomp(as.data.frame(test_images_flat))\nimages_pc <- as.data.frame(images_pca$x)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](17-nn_files/figure-pdf/unnamed-chunk-27-1.pdf){width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nLooking only at the first two principal components we note some clear differences from the transformation in the hidden layer. The observations seem to be more evenly spread in the input space, while in the activations space we notice grouping along specific directions. In particular the category \"Bag\" appears to be most different from all other classes, and the non-linear transformation in the activations space shows that they are clearly different from the shoe categories, while in the input space we could note some overlap in the linear projection. To better identify differences between other groups we will use the tour on the first five principal components.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: {#fig-fashion-gt-html layout-ncol=2}\n\n![Input space](gifs/fashion_images_gt.gif){#fig-fashion-input fig-alt=\"FIX ME\" width=200}\n\n![Activations](gifs/fashion_activations_gt.gif){#fig-fashion-activation fig-alt=\"FIX ME\" width=200}\n\nComparison of the test observations in the first five principal components of the input space (left) and in the hidden layer activations (right).

The activation function results in more clearly defined grouping of the different classes.\n:::\n:::\n\nAs with the first two principal components we get a much more spread out distribution in the original space. Nevertheless we can see differences between the classes, and that some groups are varying along specific directions in that space. Overall the activations space shows tighter clusters as expected after including the ReLU activation function, but the picture is not as neat as the first two principal components would suggest. While certain groups appear very compact even in this larger subspace, others vary quite a bit within part of the space. For example we can clearly see the \"Bag\" observations as different from all other images, but also notice that there is a large variation within this class along certain directions.\n\nFinally we will investigate the model performance through the misclassifications and uncertainty between classes. We start with the error matrix for the test observations. To fit the error matrix we use the numeric labels, the ordering is as defined above for the labels.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfashion_test_pred <- predict(model_fashion_mnist,\n                             test_images, verbose = 0)\nfashion_test_pred_cat <- levels(test_tags)[\n  apply(fashion_test_pred, 1,\n        which.max)]\npredicted <- factor(\n  fashion_test_pred_cat,\n  levels=levels(test_tags)) %>%\n  as.numeric() - 1\nobserved <- as.numeric(test_tags) -1\ntable(observed, predicted)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        predicted\nobserved    0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9\n       0  128    0   84  719   10    0   51    7    1    0\n       1    0   42   15  941    0    0    0    2    0    0\n       2    6    0  824   38  121    0    3    8    0    0\n       3    1    0   14  976    8    0    1    0    0    0\n       4    1    0  205  181  605    0    0    8    0    0\n       5    1    0    0    2    0   77    0  902    1   17\n       6   24    0  231  282  405    0   44   12    2    0\n       7    0    0    0    0    0    0    0 1000    0    0\n       8   17    1   78  102   49    0    5  730   16    2\n       9    0    0    0    2    0    0    0  947    0   51\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom this we see that the model mainly confuses certain categories with each other, and within expected groups (e.g. different types of shoes can be confused with each other, or different types of shirts). We can further investigate this by visualizing the full probability matrix for the test observations, to see which categories the model is uncertain about.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nFor this data using explainers like SHAP is not so interesting, since the individual pixel contribution to a prediction are typically not of interest. With image classification a next step might be to further investigate which part of the image is important for a prediction, and this can be visualized as a heat map placed over the original image. This is especially interesting in the case of difficult or misclassified images. This however is beyond the scope of this book.\n\n\n<!--\nThis chapter will likely include:\n\n- Models at nodes or epochs \n- Predictions (like vote matrix) for training and test.

The problem with the NN model fitted to the penguins is that the Gentoo are poorly classified, when they should be perfectly predictable due to the big gap between class clusters. Re-fit the NN to the penguins data, to find a better model that appropriately perfectly predicts Gentoo penguins. Support this by plotting the model (using the hidden layer), and the predictive probabilities as a ternary plot. Do the SHAP values also support that `bd` plays a stronger role in your best model? (`bd` is the main variable for distinguishing Gentoo's from the other species, particularly when used with `fl` or `bl`.)\n2. For the fashion MNIST data we have seen that certain categories are more likely to be confused with each other. Select a subset of the data including only the categories Ankle boot, Sneaker and Sandal and see if you can reproduce the analysis of the penguins data in this chapter with this subset.\n3. XXX fake trees, can we think about the number of nodes and make it work with a simple NN similar to penguins data?\n4. The sketches data could also be considered a classic image classification problem, and we have seen that we can get a reasonable accuracy with a random forest model. Because we only have a smaller number of observations (compared to the fashion MNIST data) when fitting a neural network we need to be very careful not to overfit the training data. Try fitting a flat neural network (similar to what we did for the fashion MNIST data) and check the test accuracy of the model.\n5. Challenge: try to design a more accurate neural network for the sketches data. Here you can investigate using a convolutional neural network in combination with data augmentation. In addition, using batch normalization should improve the model performance.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n",
