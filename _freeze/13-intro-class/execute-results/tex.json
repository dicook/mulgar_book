An increase in the collection of data, and storage in databases, in the late twentieth century has inspired a growing desire to extract knowledge from data, particularly to be able accurately predict the class labels. This has contributed to an explosion of research on new methods, especially on algorithms that focus on accurate prediction of new data based on training samples.\n\n\\index{classification!supervised}\n\nIn contrast to unsupervised classification, the class label (categorical response variable) is known, in the training sample. The training sample is used to build the prediction model, and also to estimate the accuracy, or inversely error, of the model for future data. It is also important to understand the model and to interpret it, so that we can know how predictions are made. High-dimensional visualisation can help with this, and helps to tackle questions like:\n\n- Are the classes well separated in the data space, so that they\ncorrespond to distinct clusters?  If so, what are the shapes of the clusters?  Is each cluster sufficiently ellipsoidal so that we can assume that the data arises from a mixture of multivariate normal distributions?  Do the clusters exhibit characteristics that suggest one algorithm in preference to others?\n- Where does the boundary between classes fall?  Are the classes\nlinearly separable, or does the difference between classes suggest\na non-linear boundary?  How do changes in the input parameters affect these boundaries? How do the boundaries generated by different methods vary?\n- What cases are misclassified, or have more uncertain predictions?  Are there places in the data space where predictions are especially good or bad?\n- Which predictors most contribute to the model predictions? Is it possible to reduce the set of explanatory variables?\n \nAddressing these types of queries also motivate the emerging field called explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), which goes beyond predictive accuracy to more completely satisfy the *desire to extract knowledge from data*. \n\nAlthough we focus on categorical response, some of the techniques here can be modified or adapted for problems with a numeric, or continuous, response variable. With a categorical response, and numerical predictors, we map colour to the response variable and use the tour to examine the relationship between predictors, and the different classes. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Examples of supervised classification patterns: (a) linearly separable, (b) linear but not completely separable, (c) non-linearly separable, (d) non-linear, but not completely separable.](13-intro-class_files/figure-pdf/fig-sup-example-1.pdf){#fig-sup-example width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@fig-sup-example shows some 2D examples where the two classes are (a) linearly separable, (b) not completely separable but linearly different, (c) non-linearly separable and (d) not completely separable but with a non-linear difference. We can also see that in (a) only the horizontal variable would be important for the model because the two classes are completely separable in this direction. Although the pattern in (c) is separable classes, most models would have difficulty capturing the separation. It is for this reason that it is important to understand the boundary between classes produced by a fitted model. In each of b, c, d it is likely that some observations would be misclassified. Identifying these cases, and inspecting where they are in the data space is important for understanding the model's future performance. \n\n\\index{data!bushfires}\n\\index{data!pisa}\n\n## Exercises {-}\n\n1. Using just the variables `se`, `maxt`, `mint`, `log_dist_road`, and \"accident\" or \"lightning\" causes, in the `bushfires` data use the tour (grand or guided using `lda_pp`) to decide \n\na. whether the two classes are separable, \nb. which variables might be more important, and \nc. whether one should fit a linear or nonlinear classifier to separate the groups by assessing whether the border between groups is linear or nonlinear.\n\n2. Make a 10% sample of the `pisa` data, stratified by the two countries, and examine the first 5 math scores `PV1MATH`-`PV5MATH`. Explain whether there is a difference between the two countries, and whether they are separable based on math scores.\n\n3. There are several interesting data sets with class variables available on the [GGobi website](http://ggobi.org/book/index.html). Examine the differences between `type` of music, based on the the variables `lvar`, `lave`, `lmax`, `lfener`, `lfreq`. Are these music types separable? If so, which variables are important. The `music` data can be read using:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nmusic <- read_csv(\"http://ggobi.org/book/data/music-sub.csv\",\n                  show_col_types = FALSE) |>\n  rename(title = `...1`) |>\n  mutate(type = factor(type))\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. The `aflw` data contains information on the [player positions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_rules_football_positions), as well as their statistics. Subset the data to `FF` (full forward), `BPL` (back pocket left) and `RR` (ruck). Examine the differences between player statistics (goals to tackles) for these positions. Explain whether the players in these positions have different profiles on the statistics, and whether the position is distinguishable based on combinations of the statistics. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.content-hidden}\nQ1 answer: \nIt is best to use the guided tour to examine differences. \n\na. The two types of causes are not separable, but there is some difference. \nb. The distance from roads is the major variable, where closer to roads indicates the fire was likely started by accident.\nc. Because there are so few accident observations and because there is not much difference between the groups a linear boundary is probably the most optimisitic. There is no strong suggestion that a non-linear boundary exists.\n\nQ2 answer:\nThe scores for both countries are elliptically shaped, and slightly shifted from each other. They are not separable, and it would be not useful to build a classifier for this data.\n\nQ3 answer:\nThe types of music are nearly separable. At least, \"Rock\" is almost perfectly separated from \"Classical\" but \"New wave\" is indistinguishable from either.\n\nThe difference is mostly due to `lave`, with smaller contributions from all of the other variables.\n\nQ4 answer:\nThe guided tour with lda_pp is best for studying this data. The players in these positions have quite different statistics, especially FF vs RR. From the final projection using the guided tour, RR is distinguishable from FF, primarily in disposals, RR makes more disposals and FF few. The other statistics that contribute to this difference are kicks, tackles, bounces and behinds. FF tend to do more bounces and behinds than RR, and RR makes more kicks and tackles. The BPL players are distinguishable from the other two based on marks, goals and handballs. BPL do more marks, and RR and FF make more goals and do more handballs.\n\nThese groups are linearly separable, but the covariance of each group is very different, so LDA could not be used. \n:::\n",
