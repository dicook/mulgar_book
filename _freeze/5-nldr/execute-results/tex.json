In statistics, it dates back to @Kr64a's work on multidimensional scaling (MDS). Some techniques only require an interpoint similarity or distance matrix as the main ingredient, rather than the full data. We'll focus on when the full data is available here, so we can also compare structure perceived using the tour on the high-dimensional space, relative to structure revealed in the low-dimensional embedding.\n\nThere are many methods available for generating non-linear low dimensional representations of the data. MDS is a classical technique that minimises the difference between two interpoint distance matrices, the distance between points in the high-dimensions, and in the low-dimensional representations. A good resource for learning about MDS is @BG05.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code to generate the 2D non-linear representation\"}\nlibrary(mulgar)\nlibrary(Rtsne)\nlibrary(uwot)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nset.seed(42)\ncnl_tsne <- Rtsne(clusters_nonlin)\ncnl_umap <- umap(clusters_nonlin)\nn1 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(cnl_tsne$Y), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  ggtitle(\"(a) t-SNE\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\nn2 <- ggplot(as.data.frame(cnl_umap), aes(x=V1, y=V2)) +\n  geom_point() + \n  ggtitle(\"(b) UMAP\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(aspect.ratio=1)\nn1 + n2\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Two non-linear embeddings of the non-linear clusters data: (a) t-SNE, (b) UMAP.

Both suggest that there are four clusters, and that some clusters are non-linearly shaped. They disagree on the type of non-linear pattern, where t-SNE represents one cluster as a wavy-shape and UMAP both have a simple parabolic shape. Popular methods in current use include t-SNE [@Maaten2008], UMAP [@McInnes2018] and PHATE [@Moon2019].\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code to create animated gif\"}\nlibrary(tourr)\nrender_gif(clusters_nonlin, \n           grand_tour(),\n           display_xy(),\n           gif_file = \"gifs/clusters_nonlin.gif\",\n           frames = 500,\n           width = 300, \n           height = 300)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n\n![Grand tour of the nonlinear clusters data set, shows four clusters.

The four clusters suggested by the NLDR methods can be seen. We also get a better sense of the relative size and proximity of the clusters. There are two small spherical clusters, one quite close to the end of the large sine wave cluster. The fourth cluster is relatively small, and has a slight curve, like a bent rod. The t-SNE representation is slightly more accurate than the UMAP representation. We would expect that the wavy cluster is the sine wave seen in the tour. \n\n\n\n::: info\nNLDR can provide useful low-dimensional summaries of high-dimensional structure but you need to check whether it is a sensible and accurate representation by comparing with what is perceivd from a tour.\n:::\n\n## Linking NLDR representation with tour view\n\nNLDR can produce useful low-dimensional summaries of structure in high-dimensional data, like those shown in @fig-nldr-clusters. However, there are numerous pitfalls. The fitting procedure can produce very different representations depending on the parameter choices, and even the random number seeding the fit. (You can check this by changing the `set.seed` in the code above, and by changing from the default parameters.) Also, it may not be possible to represent the high-dimensional structures faithfully low dimensions. For these reasons, one needs to connect the NLDR view with a tour of the data, to help assess its usefulness and accuracy. For example, with this data, we would want to know which of the two curved clusters in the UMAP representation correspond to the sine wave cluster. \n\n### Using `liminal`\n\n@fig-liminal-clusters-nonlin shows how the NLDR plot can be linked to a tour view, using the `liminal` package, to better understand how well the structure of the data is represented. Here we see learn that the smile in the UMAP embedding is the small bent rod cluster, and that the unibrow is the sine wave. \n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(liminal)\numap_df <- data.frame(umapX = cnl_umap[, 1],\n                      umapY = cnl_umap[, 2])\nlimn_tour_link(\n  umap_df,\n  clusters_nonlin,\n  cols = x1:x4\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-liminal-clusters-nonlin}\n\n![Smile matches bent rod.](images/liminal-clusters-nonlin1.png){#fig-smile}\n\n![Unibrow matches sine wave.](images/liminal-clusters-nonlin2.png){#fig-unibrow}\n\nTwo screenshots from liminal showing which clusters match between the UMAP representation and the tour animation. The smile corresponds to the small bent rod cluster. The unibrow matches to the sine wave cluster.\n:::\n\n### Using `detourr`\n\n@fig-detourr-clusters-nonlin shows how the linking is achieved using `detourr`. It uses a shared data object, as made possible by the `crosstalk` package, and the UMAP view is made interactive using `plotly`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(detourr)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(crosstalk)\nlibrary(plotly)\numap_df <- data.frame(umapX = cnl_umap[, 1],\n                      umapY = cnl_umap[, 2])\ncnl_df <- bind_cols(clusters_nonlin, umap_df)\nshared_cnl <- SharedData$new(cnl_df)\n\ndetour_plot <- detour(shared_cnl, tour_aes(\n  projection = starts_with(\"x\"))) |>\n    tour_path(grand_tour(2), \n                    max_bases=50, fps = 60) |>\n       show_scatter(alpha = 0.7, axes = FALSE,\n                    width = \"100%\", height = \"450px\")\n\numap_plot <- plot_ly(shared_cnl,\n                    x = ~umapX, \n                    y = ~umapY,\n                    color = I(\"black\"),\n                    height = 450) %>%\n    highlight(on = \"plotly_selected\", \n              off = \"plotly_doubleclick\") %>%\n    add_trace(type = \"scatter\", \n              mode = \"markers\")\n\nbscols(\n     detour_plot, umap_plot,\n     widths = c(5, 6)\n )\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n![Screenshot from detourr showing which clusters match between the UMAP representation and the tour animation. The smile corresponds to the small bent rod cluster.](images/detourr-clusters-nonlin.png){#fig-detourr-clusters-nonlin}\n\n## Example: `fake_trees`\n\n@fig-liminal-trees shows a more complex example, using the `fake_trees` data. We know that the 10D data has a main branch, and 9 branches (clusters) attached to it, absed on our explorations in the earlier chapters. The t-SNE view, where points are coloured by the known branch ids, is very helpful for seeing the linear branch structure. \n\nWhat we can't tell is that there is a main branch from which all of the others extend. We also can't tell which of the clusters corresponds to this branch. Linking the plot with a tour helps with this. Although, not shown in the sequence of snapshots in @fig-liminal-trees, the main branch is actually the dark blue cluster, which is separated into three pieces by t-SNE.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-summary=\"Code to run liminal on the fake trees data\"}\nlibrary(liminal)\nlibrary(Rtsne)\ndata(fake_trees)\nset.seed(2020)\ntsne <- Rtsne::Rtsne(dplyr::select(fake_trees, dplyr::starts_with(\"dim\")))\ntsne_df <- data.frame(tsneX = tsne$Y[, 1],\n                      tsneY = tsne$Y[, 2])\nlimn_tour_link(\n  tsne_df,\n  fake_trees,\n  cols = dim1:dim10,\n  color = branches\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {#fig-liminal-trees}\n\n![Linked views of t-SNE dimension reduction with a tour of the fake trees data.

Using the `penguins_sub` data generate a 2D representation using t-SNE. Plot the points mapping the colour to species. What is most surprising? (Hint: Are the three species represented by three distinct clusters?)\n2. Re-do the t-SNE representation with different parameter choices. Are the results different each time, or could they be considered to be equivalent?\n3. Use `liminal` to link the t-SNE representation to a tour of the penguins. Highlight the points that have been placed in an awkward position by t-SNE from others in their species. Watch them relative to the others in their species in the tour view, and think about whether there is any rationale for the awkward placement.\n4. Use UMAP to make the 2D representation, and use `liminal` to link with a tour to explore the result.\n5. Repeat 1-4 using `detourr`. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n<!--\n![The t-SNE mapping of the penguins data inaccurately splits one of the clusters.
