One thing that I really liked in the first edition is the emphasis on analysis\nquestion of interest and the little notes about the data. I believe the original layout was to put the data in order of appearance of the book, which naturally clusters them by technique.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\\begin{longtable}{llll}\n\\toprule\nName & Description & Source & Analysis \\\\ \n\\midrule\naflw & Player statistics from the AFLW & cassowaryr & clustering, dimension reduction \\\\ \nbushfires & Multivariate spatio-temporal data for locations of bushfires & spotoroo & clustering, classification with RF \\\\ \noz\\_election\\_2001 & Socioecenomic characterisitcs of Australian electorates in 2001 & https://github.com/jforbes14/eechidna-paper & multicollinearity (dimension reduction) \\\\ \noz\\_election\\_2016 & Socioecenomic characterisitcs of Australian electorates in 2016 & https://github.com/jforbes14/eechidna-paper & multicollinearity (dimension reduction) \\\\ \npenguins & Measure four physical characteristics of three species of penguins & https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/ & Classification, and clustering \\\\ \npisa & OECD programme for international student assessment data & learningtower & dimension reduction, regression \\\\ \nsketches & Google's Quickdraw data & https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com/ & neural networks, classification \\\\ \nclusterchallenge & Simulated data used to show various cluster examples & liminal & clustering \\\\ \n\\bottomrule\n\\end{longtable}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Australian Football League Women\n\n### Description {-}\n\nThe `aflw` data is from the 2021 Women's Australian Football League.

One also might be tempted to cluster the players, but there are no obvious clusters so it could be frustrating. At best one could partition the players into groups, while recognising there are no absolutely distinct and separated groups.\n\n### Source {-}\n\nSee the information provided with the [fitzRoy](https://jimmyday12.github.io/fitzRoy/) package.\n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nThe code for downloading and pre-processing the data is available at the [mulgar](https://dicook.github.io/mulgar/) website in the `data-raw` folder. The data provided by the fitzRoy package was pre-processed to reduce the variables to only those that relate to player skills and performance. It is possible that using some transformations on the variables would be useful to make them less skewed. \n\n## Bushfires\n\n### Description {-}\n\nThis data was collated by Weihao (Patrick) Li as part of his Honours research at Monash University. It contains fire ignitions as detected from satellite hotspots, and processed using the [spotoroo](https://tengmcing.github.io/spotoroo/) package, augmented with measurements on weather, vegetation, proximity to human activity. The cause variable is predicted based on historical fire ignition data collected by County Fire Authority personnel.\n\n### Variables {-}\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output

Source {-}\n\nCollated data was part of Weihao Li's Honours thesis, which is not publicly available. The hotspots data was collected from @jaxa, climate data was taken from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using the `bomrang` package [@R-bomrang], wind data from @wind and @windasos, vegetation data from @forest, distance from roads calculated using @OpenStreetMap, CFA stations from @cfa, and campsites from @recreation. The cause was predicted from training data provided by @fireorigin.\n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nThe 60 variables are too many to view with a tour, so it should be pre-processed using principal component analysis. The categorical variables of FOR_TYPE and FOR_CAT are removed. It would be possible to keep these if they are converted to dummy (binary variables).\n\n\n## Australian election data\n\n### Description {-}\n\nThis is data from a study on the relationship between voting patterns and socio-demographic characteristics of Australian electorates reported in @eechidna.

Code to construct the data, and the original data are available at https://github.com/jforbes14/eechidna-paper. \n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nConsiderable pre-processing was done to produce these data sets. The original data was wrangled into tidy form, some variables were log transformed to reduce skewness, and a subset of variables was chosen. \n\n## Palmer penguins\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\npenguins <- penguins %>%\n  na.omit() # 11 observations out of 344 removed\n# use only vars of interest, and standardise\n# them for easier interpretation\npenguins_sub <- penguins %>% \n  select(bill_length_mm,\n         bill_depth_mm,\n         flipper_length_mm,\n         body_mass_g,\n         species, \n         sex) %>% \n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),  ~ scale(.)[,1])) %>%\n  rename(bl = bill_length_mm,\n         bd = bill_depth_mm,\n         fl = flipper_length_mm,\n         bm = body_mass_g)\nsave(penguins_sub, file=\"data/penguins_sub.rda\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### Description {-}\n\nThis data measure four physical characteristics of three species of penguins.  \n\n### Variables {-}\n\n|Name      | Description     |\n|:---------|:----------------|\n|`bl`      | a number denoting bill length (millimeters) |\n`bd`      | a number denoting bill depth (millimeters) |\n|`fl`      | an integer denoting flipper length (millimeters) |\n|`bm`      | an integer denoting body mass (grams) |\n|`species` | a factor denoting penguin species (Adélie, Chinstrap and Gentoo) |\n\n### Purpose {-}\n\nThe primary goal is to find a combination of the four variables where the three species are distinct. This is also a useful data set to illustrate cluster analysis.\n\n### Source {-}\n\nDetails of the penguins data can be found at [https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/), and @R-palmerpenguins is the package source.\n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nThe data is loaded from the `palmerpenguins` package. The four physical measurement variables and the species are selected, and the penguins with missing values are removed. Variables are standardised, and their names are shortened.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\npenguins <- penguins %>%\n  na.omit() # 11 observations out of 344 removed\n# use only vars of interest, and standardise\n# them for easier interpretation\npenguins_sub <- penguins[,c(3:6, 1)] %>% \n  mutate(across(where(is.numeric),  ~ scale(.)[,1])) %>%\n  rename(bl = bill_length_mm,\n         bd = bill_depth_mm,\n         fl = flipper_length_mm,\n         bm = body_mass_g) %>%\n  as.data.frame()\nsave(penguins_sub, file=\"data/penguins_sub.rda\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Program for International Student Assessment \n\n### Description {-}\n\nThe `pisa` data contains plausible scores for math, reading and science of Australian and Indonesian students from the 2018 testing cycle.  The plausible scores are simulated from a model fitted to the original data, to preserve privacy of the students.\n\n### Variables {-}\n\n|Name      | Description     |\n|:---------|:----------------|\n|`CNT`      | country, either AUS for Australia or IDN for Indonesia |\n|`PV1MATH`-`PV10MATH` | plausible scores for math |\n|`PV1READ`-`PV10READ` | plausible scores for reading |\n|`PV1SCIE`-`PV10SCIE` | plausible scores for science |\n\n### Purpose {-}\n\nPrimarily this data is useful as an example for dimension reduction.\n\n### Source {-}\n\nThe full data is available from https://www.oecd.org/pisa/. There are records of the student test scores, along with survey data from the students, their households and their schools.\n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nThe data was reduced to country and the plausible scores, and filtered to the two countries. It may be helpful to know that the SPSS format data was used, and was read into R using the `read_sav()` function in the `haven` package. \n\n## Sketches \n\n### Description {-}\n\nThis data is a subset of images from https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com The subset was created using the quickdraw R package at https://huizezhang-sherry.github.io/quickdraw/. It has 6 different groups: banana, boomerang, cactus, flip flops, kangaroo. Each image is 28x28 pixels. The `sketches_train` data would be used to train a classification model, and the unlabelled `sketches_test` can be used for prediction. \n\n### Variables {-}\n\n|Name      | Description     |\n|:---------|:----------------|\n|`V1-V784`      | grey scale 0-255 |\n|`word` | what the person was asked to draw, NA in the test data |\n|`id` | unique id for each sketch |\n\n### Purpose {-}\n\nPrimarily this data is useful as an example for supervised classification, and also dimension reduction.\n\n### Source {-}\n\nThe full data is available from https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com. \n\n### Pre-processing {-}\n\nIt is typically useful to pre-process this data into principal components.

Several\nof these were related to networks which we are not including this time. I have\ntried to give a mix of things on a variety of topics. It would be nice to\nsee if there's updated versions of the \"tips\" \n(there seems to be a lot of noise in the literature here and no open datasets) and \nDi's music data (perhaps we could scrape our own spotify accounts to get an equivalent), there are also a few audio challenge datasets like [FSD50K](https://zenodo.org/record/4060432#.YCHksxMzbWY) . I think\nit would be useful to have more unstructured data sets like natural text that we have used for 1010.\n\n\n### Other possible sources for data {-}\n\nThere are now many search engines available for datasets that originate\nfrom research contexts that list licensing information and DOIs:\n\n* https://zenodo.org (mostly ecology/biology)\n* https://datadryad.org/stash (mostly biology)\n* https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/harvard/ (mostly social sciences, but has a mixture of things)\n* There's also a big list of datasets here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejOJTNTL5ApCuGTUciV0REEEAqvhI2Rd2FCoj7afops/edit#gid=0 (all psychology related)\n* TidyTuesday\n    * https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-03-29/readme.md Would need to rearrange data to look at count, participation, revenue, expenditure\n* gapminder\n* accounting records\n* Lyn's ecology data\n* learningtower, yowie\n\n-->\n",
