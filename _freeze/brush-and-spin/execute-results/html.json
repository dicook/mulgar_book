The steps are:\n\n1. Run the (grand) tour.\n2. Stop when you see a separated cluster of points.\n3. Paint the cluster a chosen colour.\n4. Repeat 1-2 until the data is grouped, and when no other separated cluster is visible in any projection. You may need to re-paint some points if they appear to be grouped incorrectly in a different projection, or paint more points that after spinning most likely belong to an existing group.\n\nSpin-and-brush is useful for exploring clustering when the data is numeric, and contains well-separated clusters. Patterns that adversely affect numerical techniques, such as nuisance variables or cases, differences in variances or shapes between clusters, don't pose any problems for spin-and-brush. It is also effective if the data has connected low-dimensional (1D or 2D) clusters in high dimensions. \n\nIt will not work very well when there are no distinct clusters and the purpose of clustering is to partition the data into subsets. Here, you could begin with a solution provided by some numerical clustering algorithm, and to use visual tools to evaluate it, with goal of refining the results.\n\nWith a complex problem where there are many clusters, one can work sequentially, and remove each cluster after it is brushed, to de-clutter the display, in order to find more clusters.\n\n<!--\n## Using `plotly`\n\n@fig-penguins-brush-and-spin shows a fixed length grand tour produced using `plotly`, with a brush tool made available to colour points. The code is messy, but follows that of [animation-tour-basic.R](https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/blob/master/demo/animation-tour-basic.R) from @plotly2020. There are key pieces in the code:\n\n1. Create the sequence of tour projections, and the data object containing data projections and projection coordinates. Include an observation id in the data object.\n2. Specify that the `id` variable is to be used to mark observations across animation frames using `highlight_key`.\n3. Draw them using `plotly`, with a `frame` parameter which specifies the animation sequence. \n4. Add a brush colour palette and specific brushing control using `highlight` to the plotly plot.\n\nThe result is an HTML object which can be saved for sharing. The drawback of this approach is that the results of the user actions cannot be saved, so you cannot recover the clusters corresponding to the colours.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Following https://github.com/plotly/plotly.R/blob/master/demo/animation-tour-basic.R\n# TURN INTO A FUNCTION TO MAKE IT EASIER\nlibrary(tourr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nload(\"data/penguins_sub.rda\")\np_mat <- as.matrix(penguins_sub[,1:4])\ntour <- new_tour(p_mat, \n                 grand_tour(), NULL)\n\ntour_dat <- function(step_size) {\n  step <- tour(step_size)\n  proj <- center(p_mat %*% step$proj)\n  data.frame(x = proj[,1], y = proj[,2], \n             species = penguins_sub$species,\n             id = 1:nrow(penguins_sub))\n}\n\nproj_dat <- function(step_size) {\n  step <- tour(step_size)\n  data.frame(\n    x = step$proj[,1], y = step$proj[,2], measure = colnames(p_mat)\n )\n}\n\nsteps <- c(0, rep(1/15, 150))\nstepz <- cumsum(steps)\n\n# tidy version of tour data\ntour_dats <- lapply(steps, tour_dat)\ntour_datz <- Map(function(x, y) cbind(x, step = y),\n                 tour_dats, stepz)\ntour_data <- dplyr::bind_rows(tour_datz)\n\ntour_data <- highlight_key(tour_data, ~id)\n\n# tidy version of tour projection data\nproj_dats <- lapply(steps, proj_dat)\nproj_datz <- Map(function(x, y) cbind(x, step = y), proj_dats, stepz)\nproj_data <- dplyr::bind_rows(proj_datz)\nproj_data$x <- proj_data$x*3\nproj_data$y <- proj_data$y*3\n\nax <- list(\n  title = \"\",\n  range = c(-3, 3),\n  zeroline = FALSE\n)\n\n# Set colors\nclrs <- grDevices::hcl.colors(6, palette=\"Zissou 1\")\n  \n# for nicely formatted slider labels\noptions(digits = 2)\n\np_b_s <- proj_data %>%\n  plot_ly(x = ~x, y = ~y, frame = ~step, \n          color = I(\"gray80\"),\n          width=600, height=600) %>%\n  config(displaylogo = FALSE, \n         modeBarButtonsToRemove = c(\"sendDataToCloud\", \"editInChartStudio\", \"zoom2d\", \"zoomIn2d\", \"zoomOut2d\", \"pan2d\", \"drawclosedpath\", \"drawopenpath\", \"autoScale2d\", \"hoverClosestCartesian\", \"hoverCompareCartesian\", \"resetScale2d\")) %>%\n  add_segments(xend = 0, yend = 0) %>%\n  add_text(text = ~measure) %>%\n  add_markers(color = I(\"black\"), data = tour_data, text = ~id, ids = ~id, hoverinfo = \"text\") %>%\n  layout(xaxis = ax, yaxis = ax) %>%\n  hide_legend() %>%\n  animation_opts(50, transition = 0, redraw = FALSE) %>%\n  highlight(on = \"plotly_selected\", \n            off = \"plotly_doubleclick\",\n            color = clrs, \n            persistent = TRUE, \n            dynamic = TRUE, \n            opacityDim = 0.5)\nhtmlwidgets::saveWidget(p_b_s,\n          file=\"html/penguins_brush_and_spin.html\",\n          selfcontained = TRUE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"pdf\"}\n\n::: {#fig-penguins-brush-and-spin fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n<iframe width=\"600\" height=\"650\" src=\"html/penguins_brush_and_spin.html\" title=\"Controls to brush and spin to discover the three clusters in the penguins data.\"></iframe>\n\nControls to brush and spin to discover the three clusters in the penguins data.

All but two of the 119 Gentoo penguins were identified as a cluster (labelled as \"3e9eb6\" from the chosen light blue hex colour), and all but three of the 146 Adelie penguins were identified as a cluster, (labelled as \"000000\" which is the unbrushed black group). Most of the Chinstrap species were recovered also (labelled as \"f5191c\" for the red hex colour).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n## Exercises {-}\n\n1. Use the spin-and-brush approach to identify the three clusters in the `mulgar::clusters` data set.\n2. Use the spin-and-brush approach to identify the six clusters in the `mulgar::multicluster` data set. (The code below using detourr could be useful.)\n3. Use spin-and-brush on the challenge data sets, `c1`-`c7` from the `mulgar` package. How many clusters do you detect in each?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"false\"}\nlibrary(detourr)\n\n# Use a random starting basis because the first two variables make it too easy\nstrt <- tourr::basis_random(10, 2)\ndetour(multicluster, \n       tour_aes(projection = -group)) |>\n       tour_path(grand_tour(2), start=strt, fps = 60) |>\n       show_scatter(alpha = 0.7, axes = FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\n3. Use the spin-and-brush technique to identify the branches of the `fake_trees` data available in the `liminal` package (originally from [PHATE](https://phate.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)).
