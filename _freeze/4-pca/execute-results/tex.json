The goal is to find a smaller set of variables, $q (< p)$, that contain as much information as the original, as possible. The new set of variables, known as principal components (PCs), are linear combinations of the original variables. The PCs can be used to represent the data in a lower-dimensional space. @joliffe2016 provides a contemporary review of the century of developments in PCA. \n\nThe process is essentially an optimisation procedure, although PCA has an analytical solution. It solves the problem of \n\n$$\n\\max_{a_k} ~\\text{Var} (Xa_k),\n$$\nwhere $X$ is the $n \\times p$ data matrix, $a_k (k=1, ..., p)$ is a 1D projection vector, called an eigenvector, and the $\\text{Var} (Xa_k)$ is called an eigenvalue. PCA is a sequential process: you first find the projection that captures the most variance, then you find a projection that is orthogonal to the first axis that captures the most variance in the $(p-1)$-dimensional space, then you find a projection that is orthogonal to the first two axes that captures the most variance in the $(p-2)$-dimensional space, and so on. The eigenvectors define the combination of the original variables, and the eigenvalues define the amount of total variance explained by each of the new of variables.\n\\index{dimension reduction!eigenvalue}\n\\index{dimension reduction!eigenvector}\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: info\nVisualisation can be used to assess if PCA is suitable to use to summarise the variation in the data.

It is also used to detect other patterns -- clustering, outliers or non-linear association -- which are interesting to find and indicate that PCA is not suitable.}\n:::\n\n\nPCA is very broadly useful for summarising linear association by using combinations of the variables that are highly correlated. However, high correlation can also occur when there are outliers, or clustering. PCA is commonly used to detect these patterns also, although this might NOT be a reliable way to do so. To detect clustering or anomalies, using more a different approach that is specifically focused on these types of patterns is advisable. To some extent capturing clustering or anomalies using PCA is actually finding problematic patterns that adversely affects conducting appropriate dimension reduction. \n\nPCA is not very effective when the distribution of the variables is highly skewed, so it can be helpful to transform variables to make them more symmetrically distributed before conducting PCA. It is also possible to summarise different types of structure by generalising the optimisation criteria to any function of projected data, $f(XA)$, which is called *projection pursuit* (PP). PP has a long history (@Kr64a, @FT74, @DF84, @JS87, @Hu85), and there are regularly new developments (e.g. @Lee2009, @perisic2009, @Lee2013, @loperfido, @bickel2018, @zhang2023). \n\n## Determining how many dimensions\n\nWe would start by examining the data using a grand tour. The goal is to check whether there might be potential issues for PCA, such as skewness, outliers or clustering, or even non-linear dependencies.\n\nWe'll start by showing PCA on the simulated data from @sec-dimension-overview. The scree plots are produced using the `mulgar::ggscree()` function, and include a grey guideline to help decide how many PCs are sufficient. This guideline is generated by taking the median value from of the eigenvalues generated by doing PCA on 100 samples from a standard multivariate normal distribution. Any values much lower than this line would indicate that those PCs are not contributing to the explanation of variation. For these three simulated examples, the scree plots illustrate that PCA supports that the data are 2D, 3D and 5D respectively.\n\n\\index{dimension reduction!scree plot}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Scree plots for the three simulated data sets shown in Figure 3.2.

The fully 5D data has no drop in variance, and all values are close to the typical value one would observe if the data was fully 5D.](4-pca_files/figure-pdf/fig-2D-pca-1.pdf){#fig-2D-pca width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next step is to look at the coefficients for the selected number of PCs. @tbl-plane-pcs shows the coefficients for the first two PCs of the `plane` data.

This pattern strongly indicates that there is one primary direction of variation in the data, with only small variation in any direction away from it.

It is quite common in PCA for the first PC to be a combination of all variables, which suggests that there is one main direction of variation in the data. Here it is not quite that. PCA suggests that the primary variation is through a combination of field skills, or basic football playing skills.\n\nThus the second PC contrasts the first, because it is primarily a combination of `shots`, `goals`, `marks_in50`, `accuracy`, and `behinds` contrasted against `rebounds_in50` and `intercepts`. The positive coefficients are primary offensive skills and the negative coefficients are defensive skills. This PC is reasonable measure of the offensive vs defensive skills of a player.\n\n\\index{dimension reduction!interpretation}\n\nWe could continue to interpret each PC by examining large coefficients to help decide how many PCs are a suitable summary of the information in the data. Briefly, PC 3 mixed but it is possibly a measure of worth of the player because `time_pct` has a large coefficient, so players that are on the field longer will contribute strongly to this new variable. It also has large (and opposite) contributions from `clearances`, `tackles`, `contested_marks`. PC 4 appears to be related to aggressive play with `clangers`, `turnovers`, `bounces` and `frees_against` featuring. All four PCs have useful information. \n\nFor deeper exploration, when we tour the four PCs, we'd like to be able to stop and identify players. This can be done by creating a pre-computed animation, with additional mouse-over, made using `plotly`. However, it is not size-efficient, can is only feasible with a small number of observations. Because all of the animation frames with the fully projected data in each, are composed into a single object, which gets large very quickly.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\nThe result is shown in @fig-aflw-pcatour.

Here there is a branching pattern, where the branch points in the direction of PC 1. Mouse-over the players at the tip of this branch and we find players like Alyce Parker, Brittany Bonnici, Dana Hooker, Kiara Bowers. If you look up the bios of these players you'll find they all have generally good player descriptions like \"elite disposals\", \"powerful left foot\", \"hard-running midfielder\", \"best and fairest\".\n\nIn the direction of PC 2, you'll find players like Lauren Ahrens, Stacey Livingstone who are star defenders. Players in this end of PC 2, have high scores on `intercepts` and `rebounds_in50`.\n\nAnother interesting frame for inspecting PC 2 is 59. PC 2 at one end has players with high goal scoring skills, and the other good defending skills. So mousing over the other end of PC 2 finds players like Gemma Houghton and Katie Brennan who are known for their goal scoring. The branch pattern is an interesting one, because it tells us there is some combination of skills that are lacking among all players, primarily this appears to be there some distinction between defenders skills and general playing skills. It's not as simple as this because the branching is only visible when PC 1 and PC 2 are examined with PC 3.\n\nPCA is useful for getting a sense of the variation in a high-dimensional data set. Interpreting the principal components is often useful, but it can be discombobulating. For the `aflw` data it would be good to think about it as a guide to the main directions of variation and to follow with a more direct engineering of variables into interesting player characteristics. For example, calculate offensive skill as an equal combination of goals, accuracy, shots, behinds. A set of new variables specifically computed to measure particular skills would make explaining an analysis easier.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: insight\nThe tour verifies that PCA on the `aflw` data is complicated and doesn't capture all of the variation.

It is analogous to a linear regression model, except that the residuals from the model are $(p-k)$-D. \n\nIt is common to show the model, that is the data projected into the $k$-D model space. When $k=2$ this is called a \"biplot\". For the `plane` and `plane_noise` data the biplots are shown in @fig-plane-biplot. This is useful for checking which variables contribute most to the new principal component variables, and also to check for any problems that might have affected the fit, such as outliers, clusters or non-linearity. Interestingly, biplots are typically only made in 2D, even if the data should be summarised by more than two PCs. Occasionally you will see the biplot made for PC $j$ vs PC $k$ also. With the `pca_tour()` function in the `tourr` package you can view a $k$-D biplot. This will display the $k$ PCs with the axes displaying the original variables, and thus show their contribution to the PCs. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Biplots of the plane (a) and plane + noise (b) data. All five variables contribute strongly to the two principal components in (a): PC1 is primarily `x1`, `x2` and `x3` and PC2 is primarily `x4` and `x5`. In (b) the same four variables contribute in almost the same way, with variables `x6` and `x7` contributing very little. The data was constructed this way, that these two dimensions were purely noise.](4-pca_files/figure-pdf/fig-plane-biplot-1.pdf){#fig-plane-biplot width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be useful to examine this model using the tour. The model is simply a plane in high dimensions. This would be considered to be the model in the data space. The reason to do this is to check how well the model fits the data. The plane corresponding to the model should be oriented along the main direction of the points, and the spread of points around the plane should be small. We should also be able to see if there has been any strong non-linear relationship missed by the model, or outliers and clusters.\n\nThe function `pca_model()` from the `mulgar` package can be used to represent the model as a $k$-D wire-frame plane. @fig-plane-box-model-pdf shows the models for the `plane` and `box` data, 2D and 3D respectively.\n\n::: {.content-visible when-format=\"html\"}\n::: info\nWe look at the model in the data space to check how well the model fits the data.
