["data.html", "Chapter 4 Data", " Chapter 4 Data This chapter describes the datasets used throughout the book, one possibility is that this could be moved to an appendix and in the online version of the book any mention of the dataset in the main text could be cross-linked to its description. One thing that I really liked in the first edition is the emphasis on analysis question of interest and the little notes about the data. I believe the original layout was to put the data in order of appearance of the book, which naturally clusters them by technique. Name Description Source Proposed Chapter Other Notes pdfsense Physics data that is featured heavily in Ursula’s work PDFSense clustering, classification An update to prim7 pedestrian Melbourne pedestrian counts rwalkr multivariate time series, regression (?) It could be turned into a multivariate time series with the addition of weather information. mouseretina Single cell RNA-seq data from Macosko et al. Bioconductor::scRNASeq dimension, clustering Used in the liminal paper, one concern is that there a lot of nuances to processing thedata that might need to be explained. An updated version of the arabidopsis expression data from 1e. pisa OECD programme for international student assessment data Di regression would need to check usage agreements sketches Google’s Quickdraw data link neural networks, classification mosquitos An audio “civic science” dataset containing wingbeat frequencies for classifying mosquito species linkdryad neural networks, classification (forests / LDA) aklhouseprices Auckland house prices collected by Earo Earo regression, toolbox would need to check usage agreements books A text dataset would be a more modern example,like those in 1010. dimension, clustering wages An updated version of the wages dataset Di regression, toolbox, multivariate time series bushfires The data Di used in her conversation article Di toolbox, forests clusterchallenge Simulated data used to show various cluster examples liminal clustering duolingo Learning traces for duolingo users github regression, forests CCBY There were fifteen datasets listed in chapter 7 of the first edition. Several of these were related to networks which we are not including this time. I have tried to give a mix of things on a variety of topics. It would be nice to see if there’s updated versions of the “tips” (there seems to be a lot of noise in the literature here and no open datasets) and Di’s music data (perhaps we could scrape our own spotify accounts to get an equivalent), there are also a few audio challenge datasets like FSD50K . I think it would be useful to have more unstructured data sets like natural text that we have used for 1010. Other possible sources for data There are now many search engines available for datasets that originate from research contexts that list licensing information and DOIs: https://zenodo.org (mostly ecology/biology) https://datadryad.org/stash (mostly biology) https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/harvard/ (mostly social sciences, but has a mixture of things) There’s also a big list of datasets here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ejOJTNTL5ApCuGTUciV0REEEAqvhI2Rd2FCoj7afops/edit#gid=0 (all psychology related) "]
