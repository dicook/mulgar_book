We are interested in examining the association between the scores. Because the association might be different for each country, PCA should be conducted separately for each country. All the scores are measured in the same units, so for this data weâ€™d recommend computing PCA on the original scale, that is, the variance-covariance matrix. Plan: show data in a tour compute PCs explore proportion of variance examine loadings tour on top few PCs, using PCA tour 3.1.1 Take a look at the raw data There are 30 variables here. 30D space is huge so generally this is too many variables to watch in a tour. Here the structure is very simple so its easy to see. Trying to display the axes is a different matter, for most directions there is a small contribution from many of the 30 variables, resulting is small axis lines but over-crowded labels. data(pisa) pisa_oz &lt;- pisa %&gt;% filter(CNT == &quot;AUS&quot;) set.seed(44) pisa_oz_500 &lt;- pisa_oz[sample(1:nrow(pisa_oz), 500),-1] # Run the tour in real time animate_xy(pisa_oz_500 , axes=&quot;bottomleft&quot;, half_range = 1.5) # Save a tour path, and select a few images to show pisa_t1 &lt;- interpolate(save_history(pisa_oz_500, max = 20)) pisa_tbl1 &lt;- convert_proj_tibble(pisa_t1) # Try animation.hook = &quot;gifski&quot; # Show a set of 10 projections indx &lt;- seq(1, 101, 10) d &lt;- pisa_tbl1 %*% dplyr::filter(frame %in% indx) # Ok, stuck here - not filtering, and then have to work ou # how to transform to make data and plots for a selection # of frames PISA_pca &lt;- prcomp(pisa[,-1], scale = FALSE) screeplot(PISA_pca, type=&quot;l&quot;) options(digits=2) summary(PISA_pca) "]]
