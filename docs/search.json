    "text": "Although there are many resources available for data visualization, there are few comprehensive resources on high-dimensional data visualisation. This book fills this gap by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to visualising high-dimensional data and models, with R.\nHigh-dimensional data spaces are fascinating places. You may think that there’s a lot of ways to plot one or two variables, and a lot of types of patterns that can be found. You might use a density plot and see skewness or a dot plot to find outliers. A scatterplot of two variables might reveal a non-linear relationship or a barrier beyond which no observations exist. We don’t as yet have so many different choices of plot types for high-dimensions, but these types of patterns are also what we seek in scatterplots of high-dimensional data. The additional dimensions can clarify these patterns, that clusters are likely to be more distinct. Observations that did not appear to be very different can be seen to be lonely anomalies in high-dimensions, that no other observations have quite the same combination of values.\nIf you encounter an error, you can report it as an issue at the Github repo for this book.\nPlease make a small reproducible example and report the error encountered.

One also might be tempted to cluster the players, but there are no obvious clusters so it could be frustrating. At best one could partition the players into groups, while recognising there are no absolutely distinct and separated groups.\n\n\nSource\nSee the information provided with the fitzRoy package.\n\n\nPre-processing\nThe code for downloading and pre-processing the data is available at the mulgar website in the data-raw folder. The data provided by the fitzRoy package was pre-processed to reduce the variables to only those that relate to player skills and performance. It is possible that using some transformations on the variables would be useful to make them less skewed."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hierarchical cluster algorithms sequentially fuse neighboring points to form ever-larger clusters, starting from a full interpoint distance matrix. is described by a “linkage method”: For example, single linkage uses the smallest interpoint distance between the members of a pair of clusters, complete linkage uses the maximum interpoint distance, and average linkage uses the average of the interpoint distances.

This is computed by:\n> library(rggobi)\n> d.prim7 <- read.csv(\"prim7.csv\")\n> d.prim7.dist <- dist(d.prim7)\n> d.prim7.dend <- hclust(d.prim7.dist, method=\"average\")\n> plot(d.prim7.dend)\n\nThe dendrogram at the top shows the result of the clustering process. Several large clusters were fused late in the process, with heights (indicated by the height of the horizontal segment connecting two clusters) well above those of the first joins; we will want to look at these. Two points were fused with the rest at the very last stages, which indicates that they are outliers and have been assigned to singleton clusters.\n\n We cut the dendrogram to produce nine clusters because we would expect to see seven clusters and a few outliers based on our observations from the spin and brush approach, and our choice looks reasonable given the structure of the dendrogram. (In practice, we would usually explore the clusters corresponding to several different cuts of the dendrogram.) We assign each cluster an integer identifier, and in the following plots, you see the results of highlighting one cluster at a time and then running the grand tour to focus on the placement of that cluster within the data. This R code follows this sequence of actions:\n> gd <- ggobi(d.prim7)[1]\n> clust9 <- cutree(d.prim7.dend, k=9)\n> glyph_color(gd)[clust9==1] <- 9 # highlight triangle\n> glyph_color(gd)[clust9==1] <- 1 # reset color\n> glyph_color(gd)[clust9==2] <- 9 # highlight cluster 2\nThe top three plots show, respectively, clusters 1, 2, and 3: These clusters roughly divide the main triangular section of the data into three. The bottom row of plots show clusters labeled 5, and 6, which lie along the linear pieces, and cluster 7, which is a singleton cluster corresponding to an outlier in the data.\nThe results are reasonably easy to interpret. Recall that the basic geometry underlying this data is that there is a 2D triangle with two linear strands extending from each vertex. The hierarchical average linkage clustering of the particle physics data using nine clusters essentially divides the data into three chunks in the neighborhood of each vertex (clusters 1, 2, and 3), three pieces at the ends of the six linear strands (4, 5, and 6), and three clusters containing outliers (7, 8, and 9). This data provides a big challenge for any cluster algorithm - low-dimensional pieces embedded in high-dimensional space - and we are not surprised that no algorithm that we have tried will extract the structure we found using interactive tools.\nThe particle physics dataset is ill-suited to hierarchical clustering, but this extreme failure is an example of a common problem. When performing cluster analysis, we want to group the observations into clusters without knowing the distribution of the data. How many clusters are appropriate? What do the clusters look like? Could we just as confidently divide the data in several different ways and get very different but equally valid interpretations? Graphics can help us assess the results of a cluster analysis by helping us explore the distribution of the data and the characteristics of the clusters.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoehmke, B., and B. M.
