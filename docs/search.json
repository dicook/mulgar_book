This book fills this gap by providing a comprehensive and up-to-date guide to visualising high-dimensional data and models, with R.\nHigh-dimensional data spaces are fascinating places. You may think that there’s a lot of ways to plot one or two variables, and a lot of types of patterns that can be found. You might use a density plot and see skewness or a dot plot to find outliers. A scatterplot of two variables might reveal a non-linear relationship or a barrier beyond which no observations exist. We don’t as yet have so many different choices of plot types for high-dimensions, but these types of patterns are also what we seek in scatterplots of high-dimensional data. The additional dimensions can clarify these patterns, that clusters are likely to be more distinct. Observations that did not appear to be very different can be seen to be lonely anomalies in high-dimensions, that no other observations have quite the same combination of values.\nIf you encounter an error, you can report it as an issue at the Github repo for this book.\nPlease make a small reproducible example and report the error encountered.

    "section": "4.1 Support vector machine",
    "text": "4.1 Support vector machine\n% http://www.support-vector-machines.org/SVM_osh.html % wikipedia\nA support vector machine (SVM) is a binary classification method. An SVM looks for gaps between clusters in the data, based on the extreme observations in each class. In this sense it mirrors the graphical approach described at the start of this chapter, in which we searched for gaps between groups. We describe this method more fully than we did the other algorithms for two reasons: first, because of its apparent similarity to the graphical approach, and second, because it is difficult to find a simple explanation of the method in the literature.\nThe algorithm takes an \\(n \\times p\\) data matrix, where each column is scaled to [$-\\(1,1] and each row is labeled as one of two classes (\\)y_i=+1$ or \\(-1\\)), and finds a hyperplane that separates the two groups, if they are separable. Each row of the data matrix is a vector in \\(p\\)-dimensional space, denoted as\n% Should this be represented as a row instead of a column? dfs\n[ =]\nand the separating hyperplane can be written as\n[ ’+ b = 0 ]\nwhere \\(\\blW = [ w_1~~ w_2 ~~ \\dots ~~ w_p]'\\) is the normal vector to the separating hyperplane and \\(b\\) is a constant. The best separating hyperplane is found by maximizing the margin of separation between the two classes as defined by two parallel hyperplanes:\n[ ‘+ b = 1, ~~~~~ ’+ b = -1. ]\nThese hyperplanes should maximize the distance from the separating hyperplane and have no points between them, capitalizing on any gap between the two classes. The distance from the origin to the separating hyperplane is \\(|b|/||\\blW||\\), so the distance between the two parallel margin hyperplanes is \\(2/||\\blW||=2/\\sqrt{w_1^2+\\dots +w_p^2}\\). Maximizing this is the same as minimizing \\(||\\blW||/2\\). To ensure that the two classes are separated, and that no points lie between the margin hyperplanes we need:\n[ ’_i + b , ~~~ ~~~’_i + b ~~~i=1, …, n ]\nwhich corresponds to\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray}\ny_i(\\blW'\\blX_i+b)\\geq 1 ~~~\\forall i=1, ..., n\n\\label{svm-crit}\n\\end{eqnarray}\\]\nThus the problem corresponds to\n\nInterestingly, only the points closest to the margin hyperplanes are needed to define the separating hyperplane. We might think of these points as lying on or close to the convex hull of each cluster in the area where the clusters are nearest to each other. These points are called support vectors, and the coefficients of the separating hyperplane are computed from a linear combination of the support vectors \\(\\blW = \\sum_{i=1}^{s} y_i\\alpha_i\\blX_i\\), where \\(s\\) is the number of support vectors. We could also use \\(\\blW = \\sum_{i=1}^n y_i\\alpha_i\\blX_i\\), where \\(\\alpha_i=0\\) if \\(\\blX_i\\) is not a support vector. For a good fit the number of support vectors \\(s\\) should be small relative to \\(n\\). Fitting algorithms can achieve gains in efficiency by using only samples of the cases to find suitable support vector candidates; this approach is used in the SVMLight software.\nIn practice, the assumption that the classes are completely separable is unrealistic. Classification problems rarely present a gap between the classes, such that there are no misclassifications. relaxed the separability condition to allow some misclassified training points by adding a tolerance value \\(\\epsilon_i\\) to Equation \\(\\ref{svm-crit}\\), which results in the modified criterion \\(y_i(\\blW'\\blX_i+b)>1-\\epsilon_i, \\epsilon_i\\geq 0\\). Points that meet this criterion but not the stricter one are called slack vectors.\nNonlinear classifiers can be obtained by using nonlinear transformations of \\(\\blX_i\\), \\(\\phi(\\blX_i)\\) , which is implicitly computed during the optimization using a kernel function \\(K\\). Common choices of kernels are linear \\(K(\\blx_i,\\blx_j)=\\blx_i'\\blx_j\\), polynomial \\(K(\\blx_i,\\blx_j)=(\\gamma\\blx_i'\\blx_j+r)^d\\), radial basis \\(K(\\blx_i,\\blx_j)=\\exp(-\\gamma||\\blx_i-\\blx_j||^2)\\), or sigmoid functions \\(K(\\blx_i,\\blx_j)=\\mbox{tanh}(\\gamma\\blx_i'\\blx_j+r)\\), where \\(\\gamma>0, r,\\) and \\(d\\) are kernel parameters.\n% She didn’t say to delete the terminating colon here, but by % analogy with these rest, I will. dfs\nThe ensuing minimization problem is formulated as\n[ |||| + C_{i=1}^n _i ~~ y_i(’()+b)>1-_i ]\nwhere \\(\\epsilon_i\\geq 0\\), \\(C>0\\) is a penalty parameter guarding against over-fitting the training data and \\(\\epsilon\\) controls the tolerance for misclassification. The normal to the separating hyperplane \\(\\blW\\) can be written as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} y_i\\alpha_i{\\phi(\\blX_i)}\\), where points other than the support and slack vectors will have \\(\\alpha_i=0\\). Thus the optimization problem becomes\n\\[\\begin{eqnarray*}\n\\mbox{\\em minimizing } \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i=1}^n\\sum_{j=1}^n y_iy_j\\alpha_i\\alpha_jK(\\blX_i,\\blX_j)+C\\sum_{i=1}^n \\epsilon_i \\\\ ~~~~~~~~~~~\\mbox{\\em subject to }\ny_i(\\blW'\\phi(\\blX)+b)>1-\\epsilon_i\n\\end{eqnarray*}\\]\n \nWe use the {} function in the package of R, which uses , to classify the oils of the four areas in the Southern region. SVM is a binary classifier, but this algorithm overcomes that limitation by comparing classes in pairs, fitting six separate classifiers, and then using a voting scheme to make predictions. To fit the SVM we also need to specify a kernel, or rely on the internal tuning tools of the algorithm to choose this for us. Automatic tuning in the algorithm chooses a radial basis, but we found that a linear kernel performed better, so that is what we used. (This accords with our earlier visual inspection of the data in Sect.~\\(\\ref{class-plots}\\).) Here is the R code used to fit the model:\nThese are our misclassification tables:\n\n\nThe training error is \\(9/246=0.037\\), and the test error is \\(6/77=0.078\\). (The training error is the same as that of the neural network classifier, but the test error is lower.) Most error is associated with Sicily, which we have seen repeatedly to be an especially difficult class to separate. In the training data there are no other errors, and in the test data there are just two samples from Calabria mistakenly classified. Figure~\\(\\ref{olive-svm}\\) illustrates our examination of the misclassified cases, one in each row of the figure. (Points corresponding to Sicily were removed from all four plots.) Each of the two cases is brushed (using a filled red circle) in the plot of misclassification table and viewed in a linked 2D tour. Both of these cases are on the edge of their clusters so the confusion of classes is reasonable.\n% Figure 14\n% Figure 15\nThe linear SVM classifier uses 20 support vectors and 29 slack vectors to define the separating planes between the four areas. It is interesting to examine which points are selected as support vectors, and where they are located in the data space. For each pair of classes, we expect to find some projection in which the support vectors line up on either side of the margin of separation, whereas the slack vectors lie closer to the boundary, perhaps mixed in with the points of other classes.\n The plots in Fig.~\\(\\ref{olive-svm2}\\) represent our use of the 2D tour, augmented by manual manipulation,~to look for these projections. (The Sicilian points are again removed.) The support vectors are represented by open circles and the slack vectors by open rectangles, and we have been able to find a number of projections in which the support vectors are on the opposing outer edge of the point clouds for each cluster.\nThe linear SVM does a very nice job with this difficult classification. The accuracy is almost perfect on three classes, and the misclassifications are quite reasonable mistakes, being points that are on the extreme edges of their clusters. However, this method joins the list of those defeated by the difficult problem of distinguishing the Sicilian oils from the rest.\n\nFor some classification problems, it is possible to get a good picture of the boundary between two classes. With LDA and SVM classifiers the boundary is described by the equation of a hyperplane. For others the boundary can be determined by evaluating the classifier on points sampled in the data space, using either a regular grid or some more efficient sampling scheme.\n% Figure 16\n We use the R package to generate points illustrating boundaries, add those points to the original data, and display them in GGobi. Figure~\\(\\ref{olive-classifly}\\) shows projections of boundaries between pairs of classes in the . In each example, we used the 2D tour with manual control~to focus the view on a projection that revealed the boundary between two groups.\n% Needs to be checked\nThe top two plots show tour projections of the North (purple) and Sardinia (green) oils where the two classes are separated and the boundary appears in gray. The LDA boundary (shown at left) slices too close to the Northern oils. This might be due to the violation of the LDA assumption that the two groups have equal variance; since that is not true here, it places the boundary too close to the group with the larger variance. The SVM boundary (at right) is a bit closer to the Sardinian oils than the LDA boundary is, yet it is still a tad too close to the oils from the North.\nThe bottom row of plots examines the more difficult classification of the areas of the South, focusing on separating the South Apulian oils (in pink), which is the largest sample, from the oils of the other areas (all in orange). Perfect separation between the classes does not occur. Both plots are tour projections showing SVM boundaries, the left plot generated by a linear kernel and the right one by a radial kernel. Recall that the radial kernel was selected automatically by the SVM software we used, whereas we actually chose to use a linear kernel. These pictures illustrate that the linear basis yields a more reasonable boundary between the two groups. The shape of the clusters of the two groups is approximately the same, and there is only a small overlap of the two. The linear boundary fits this structure neatly. The radial kernel wraps around the South Apulian oils."

    "text": "5.1 Definition\nFisher’s linear discriminant (Fisher 1936) computes a linear combination of the variables that separates two classes by comparing the differences between class means with the variance of values within each class. It makes no assumptions about the distribution of the data.\nLinear discriminant analysis (LDA), as proposed by Rao (1948), formalizes Fisher’s approach, by recognising that it arises from making the assumption that the data values for each class arise from a \\(p\\)-dimensional multivariate normal distribution, sharing a common variance-covariance matrix with data from other classes. When this assumption holds, Fisher’s linear discriminant gives the optimal separation between the two groups.\nFor two equally weighted groups, where \\(Y\\) is coded as \\(\\{0, 1\\}\\), the LDA rule is:\nAllocate a new observation \\(X_0\\) to group 1 if\n\\[(\\bar{X}_1-\\bar{X}_2)'S^{-1}_{\\rm pooled}X_0 \\geq\n  \\frac{1}{2}(\\bar{X}_1-\\bar{X}_2)'S^{-1}_{\\rm pooled}\n  (\\bar{X}_1+\\bar{X}_2)\\]\nelse allocate it to group 2,\nwhere ${X}_k $ are the class mean vectors of an \\(n\\times p\\) data matrix \\(X_k ~~(k=1,2)\\),\n\\[S_{\\rm pooled} = \\frac{(n_1-1) S_1}{(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)} + \\frac{(n_2-1) S_2}{(n_1-1)+(n_2-1)}\\]\nis the pooled variance-covariance matrix, and\n\\[S_k = \\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum_{i=1}^{n}\n(X_{ki}-\\bar{X}_k)(X_{ki}-\\bar{X}_k)', ~~k=1,2\\]\nis the class variance–covariance matrix. The linear discriminant part of this rule is \\((\\bar{X}_1-\\bar{X}_2)'S^{-1}_{\\rm pooled}\\), which defines the linear combination of variables that best separates the two groups. To define a classification rule, we compute the value of the new observation \\(X_0\\) on this line and compare it with the value of the average of the two class means \\((\\bar{X}_1+\\bar{X}_2)/2\\) on the same line.\nFor multiple \\((g)\\) classes, the rule and the discriminant space are constructed using the between-group sum-of-squares matrix,\n\\[B=\\sum_{k=1}^g n_k(\\bar{X}_k-\\bar{X})(\\bar{X}_k-\\bar{X})'\\]\nwhich measures the differences between the class means, compared with the overall data mean \\(\\bar{X}\\) and the within-group sum-of-squares matrix,\n\\[W =\n\\sum_{k=1}^g\\sum_{i=1}^{n_k}\n(X_{ki}-\\bar{X}_k)(X_{ki}-\\bar{X}_k)'\\]\nwhich measures the variation of values around each class mean. The linear discriminant space is generated by computing the eigenvectors (canonical coordinates) of \\(W^{-1}B\\), and this is the space where the group means are most separated with respect to the pooled variance–covariance. The resulting classification rule is to allocate a new observation to the class with the highest value of\n\\[\\bar{X}_k'S^{-1}_{\\rm pooled}X_0 -\n\\frac{1}{2}\\bar{X}_k'S^{-1}_{\\rm pooled}\\bar{X}_k ~~~k=1,...,g\\]\nwhich results in allocating the new observation into the class with the closest mean."

    "section": "6.1 Trees",
    "text": "6.1 Trees\nThe tree algorithm Breiman et al. (1984) is a long-established versatile algorithmic method for supervised classification. The basic tree algorithm generates a classification rule by sequentially splitting the data into two buckets. Splits are made between sorted data values of individual variables, with the goal of obtaining pure classes on each side of the split. The inputs for a simple tree classifier commonly include (1) an impurity measure, an indication of the relative diversity among the cases in the terminal nodes; (2) a parameter that sets the minimum number of cases in a node, or the minimum number of observations in a terminal node of the tree; and (3) a complexity measure that controls the growth of a tree, balancing the use of a simple generalizable tree against a more accurate tree tailored to the sample. When applying tree methods, exploring the effects of the input parameters on the tree is instructive; for example, it helps us to assess the stability of the tree model.\nAlthough algorithmic models do not depend on distributional assumptions, that does not mean that every algorithm is suitable for all data. For example, the tree model works best when all variables are independent within each class, because it does not take such dependencies into account. Visualization can help us to determine whether a particular model should be applied. In classification problems, it is useful to explore the cluster structure, comparing the clusters with the classes and looking for evidence of correlation within each class. The upper left-hand plot in ?fig-lda-assumptions shows a strong correlation between tars1 and tars2 within each cluster, which indicates that the tree model may not give good results for the . The plots in ?fig-misclassifications provide added evidence. They use background color to display the class predictions for LDA and a tree. The LDA boundaries, which are formed from a linear combination of tars1 and tars2, look more appropriate than the rectangular boundaries of the tree classifier.\n\nHastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman (2001) and Bishop (2006) include thorough discussions of algorithms for supervised classification presented from a modeling perspective with a theoretical emphasis. Ripley (1996) is an early volume describing and illustrating both classical statistical methods and algorithms for supervised classification. All three books contain some excellent examples of the use of graphics to examine two-dimensional (2D) boundaries generated by different classifiers. The discussions in these and other writings on data mining algorithms take a less exploratory approach than that of this chapter, and they lack treatments of the use of graphics to examine the high-dimensional spaces in which the classifiers operate.\n\n6.1.1 Studying the fit\n \nA classifier’s performance is usually assessed using its error or, conversely, its accuracy. Error is calculated by comparing the predicted class with the known true class, using a misclassification table. For example, below are the respective misclassification tables for LDA and the tree classifier applied to the :\n\nThe total error is the number of misclassified samples divided by the total number of cases: \\(4/74=0.054\\) for LDA and \\(5/74=0.068\\) for the tree classifier.\nIt is informative to study the misclassified cases and to see which pockets of the data space contain more error. The misclassified cases for LDA and tree classifiers are highlighted (large orange \\(\\times\\)es and large green circles) in ?fig-misclassifications. Some errors made by the tree classifier, such as the uppermost large green circle, seem especially egregious. As noted earlier, they result from the limitations of the algorithm when variables are correlated.\n\nTo be useful, the error estimate should predict the performance of the classifier on new samples not yet seen. However, if the error is calculated using the same data that was used by the classifier, it is likely to be too low. Many methods are used to avoid double-dipping from the data, including several types of . A simple example of cross-validation is to split the data into a training sample (used by the classifier) and a test sample (used for calculating error).\n \nEnsemble methods build cross-validation into the error calculations. Ensembles are constructed by using multiple classifiers and by pooling the predictions using a voting scheme. A random forest Breiman and Cutler (2004), for example, builds in cross-validation by constructing multiple trees, each of which is generated by randomly sampling the input variables and the cases. Because each tree is built using a sample of the cases, there is in effect a training sample and a test sample for each tree. (See sec-random-forests for more detail.)"

    "text": "6.2 Random forests\n\n\n\nA random forest Breiman and Cutler (2004) is a classifier that is built from multiple trees generated by randomly sampling the cases and the variables. The random sampling (with replacement) of cases has the fortunate effect of creating a training (in-bag'') and a test (out-of-bag’’) sample for each tree computed. The class of each case in the out-of-bag sample for each tree is predicted, and the predictions for all trees are combined into a vote for the class identity.\nA random forest is a computationally intensive method, a ``black box’’ classifier, but it produces various diagnostics that make the outcome less mysterious. Some diagnostics that help us to assess the model are the votes, the measures of variable importance, the error estimate, and as usual, the misclassification tables.\n\nWe test the method on the by building a random forest classifier of 500 trees, using the R package randomForest Liaw et al. (2006):\n\n\n\nEach tree used a random sample of four of the eight variables, as well as a random sample of about a third of the 572 cases. The votes are displayed in the left-hand plot of ?fig-olive-forest, next to a projection from a 2D tour. Since there are three classes, the votes form a triangle, with one vertex for each region, with oils from the South at the far right, Sardinian oils at the top, and Northern oils at the lower left. Samples that are consistently classified correctly are close to the vertices; cases that are commonly misclassified are further from a vertex. Although forests perfectly classify this data, the number of points falling between the Northern and the Sardinian vertices suggests some potential for error in classifying future samples.\nFor more understanding of the votes, we turn to another diagnostic: variable importance. Forests return two measures of variable importance, both of which give similar results. Based on the Gini measure, the most important variables, in order, are eicosenoic, linoleic, oleic, palmitic, arachidic, palmitoleic, linolenic, and stearic.\nSome of this ordering is as expected, given the initial graphical inspection of the data (?sec-class-plots). The importance of eicosenoic was our first discovery, as shown in the top row of ?fig-olive-1d. And yes, linoleic is next in importance: The first two plots in ?fig-olive-2d make that clear. The surprise is that the forest should consider arachidic to be less important than palmitic. This is not what we found, as shown in the right-hand plot in that figure.\nDid we overlook something important in our earlier investigation? We return to the use of the manual manipulation of the tour to see whether palmitic does in fact perform better than arachidic at finding a gap between the two regions. But it does not. By overlooking the importance of arachidic, the random forest never finds an adequate gap between the oils of the Northern and the Sardinian regions, and that probably explains why there is more confusion about some Northern samples than there should be.\nWe rebuild the forest using a new variable constructed from a linear combination of linoleic and arachidic (linoarach), just as we did when applying the single tree classifier. Since correlated variables reduce each other’s importance, we need to remove linoleic and oleic when we add linoarach. Once we have done this, the confusion between Northern and Sardinian oils disappears ?fig-olive-forest, lower plot): The points are now tightly clumped at each vertex, which indicates more certainty in their class predictions. The new variable becomes the second most important variable according to the importance diagnostic.\nClassifying the oils by the three large regions is too easy a problem for forests; they are designed to tackle more challenging classification tasks. We will use them to examine the oils from the areas in the Southern region (North and South Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily). Remember the initial graphical inspection of the data, which showed that oils from the four areas were not completely separable. The samples from Sicily overlapped those of the three other areas. We will use a forest classifier to see how well it can differentiate the Southern oils by area:\nAfter experimenting with several input parameters, we show the results for a forest of 1,500 trees, sampling two variables at each tree node, and yielding an error rate of 0.068. The misclassification table is:\n\nThe error of the forest is surprisingly low, but the error is definitely not uniform across classes. Predictions for Sicily are wrong about a third of the time. Figure~\\(\\ref{olive-forest2}\\) shows some more interesting aspects of the results. For this figure, the following table describes the correspondence between area and symbol:\n\n\nLook first at the top row of the figure. The misclassification table is represented by a jittered scatterplot, at the left. A plot from a 2D tour of the four voting variables is in the center. Because there are four groups, the votes lie on a 3D tetrahedron (a simplex). The votes from three of the areas are pretty well separated, one at each ``corner,’’ but those from Sicily overlap all of them. Remember that when points are clumped at the vertex, class members are consistently predicted correctly. Since this does not occur for Sicilian oils, we see that there is more uncertainty in the predictions for this area.\nThe plot at right confirms this observation. It is a projection from a 2D tour of the four most important variables, showing a pattern we have seen before. We can achieve pretty good separation of the oils from North Apulia, Calabria, and South Apulia, but the oils from Sicily overlap all three clusters. Clearly these are tough samples to classify correctly.\n\n\nWe remove the Sicilian oils from the plots so we can focus on the other three areas (bottom row of plots). The points representing North Apulian oils form a very tight cluster at a vertex, with three exceptions. Two of these points are misclassified as Calabrian, and we have highlighted them as large filled circles by painting the misclassification plot.\nThe pattern of the votes (middle plot) suggests that there is high certainty in the predictions for North Apulian oils, with the exception of these two samples. When we watch the votes in the tour for a while, we see that the votes of these two samples travel as if they were in a cluster all their own, which is distinct from the remaining North Apulian oils.\nHowever, when we look at the data, we find the votes for these two samples a bit puzzling. We watch the four most important variables in the tour for a while (as in the right plot), and these two points do not behave as if they were in a distinct cluster; they travel with the rest of the samples from North Apulia. They do seem to be outliers with respect their class, but they are not so far from their group - it is a bit surprising that the forest has trouble classifying these cases.\nRather than exploring the other misclassifications, we leave that for the reader.\nIn summary, a random forest is a useful method for tackling tough classification problems. Its diagnostics provide a rich basis for graphical exploration, which helps us to digest and evaluate the solution."

    "text": "Neural networks for classification can be thought of as additive models where explanatory variables are transformed, usually through a logistic function, added to other explanatory variables, transformed again, and added again to yield class predictions. Aside from the data mining literature, mentioned earlier, a good comprehensive and accessible description for statisticians can be found in . The model can be formulated as:\n[ = f(x) = (+{h=1}^{s} w{h}(h+{i=1}^{p} w_{ih}x_i)) ]\n\nwhere \\(x\\) is the vector of explanatory variable values, \\(y\\) is the target value, \\(p\\) is the number of variables, \\(s\\) is the number of nodes in the single hidden layer, and \\(\\phi\\) is a fixed function, usually a linear or logistic function. This model has a single hidden layer and univariate output values. The model is fit by minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed values and fitted values, and the minimization does not always converge. A neural network is a black box that accepts inputs, computes, and spits out predictions. With graphics, some insight into the black box can be gained. We use the feed-forward neural network provided in the {} package of R to illustrate.\nWe continue to work with , and we look at the performance of the neural network in classifying the oils in the four areas of the South, a difficult challenge. Because the software does not include a method for computing the predictive error, we break the data into training and test samples so we can better estimate the predictive error. (We could tweak the neural network to perfectly fit all the data, but then we could not estimate how well it would perform with new data.)\n% this may need a few more words\nAfter trying several values for \\(s\\), the number of nodes in the hidden layer, we chose \\(s=4\\); we also chose a linear \\(\\phi\\), \\(decay=0.005\\), and \\(range=0.06\\). We fit the model using many different random starting values, rejecting the results until it eventually converged to a solution with a reasonably low error:\n% Insert page break to avoid breaking the R output.\nBelow are the misclassification tables for the training and test samples.\n\n\nThe training error is \\(9/246=0.037\\), and the test error is \\(12/77=0.156\\). The overall errors, as in the random forest model, are not uniform across classes. This is particularly obvious in the test error table: The error in classifying North Apulian oils is close to a third, and it is even worse for Sicilian oils, which have an almost even chance of being misclassified.\nOur exploration of the misclassifications is shown in Fig.~\\(\\ref{olive-nn}\\). (The troublesome Sicilian oils have been excluded from all plots in this figure.) Consider first the plots in the top row. The left-hand plot shows the misclassification table. Two samples of oils from North Apulia (orange \\(+\\)) have been incorrectly classified as South Apulian (pink \\(\\times\\)), and these two points have been brushed as filled orange circles. Note where these points fall in the next two plots, which are linked 2D tour projections. One of the two misclassified points is on the edge of the cluster of North Apulian points, close to the Calabrian cluster. It is understandable that there might be some confusion about this case. The other sample is on the outer edge of the North Apulian cluster, but it is far from the Calabrian cluster — this should not have been confused.\n% Figure 13\nIn the bottom row of plots, we follow the same procedure to examine the single North Apulian sample misclassified as South Apulian. It is painted as a filled orange circle in the misclassification plot and viewed in a tour. This point is on the outer edge of the North Apulian cluster, but it is closer to the Calabrian cluster than the South Apulian cluster. It would be understandable for it to be misclassified as Calabrian, so it is puzzling that it is misclassified as South Apulian.\nIn summary, a neural network is a black box method for tackling tough classification problems. It will generate different solutions each time the net is fit, some much better than others. When numerical measures suggest that a reasonable model has been found, graphics can be used to inspect the model in more detail."

For example, the Euclidean distance between cases 1 and 2 in the above data, is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd_{\\rm Euc}(a_1,a_2) &= \\sqrt{(7.3-7.4)^2+(7.6-7.2)^2+ (7.7-7.3)^2+(8.0-7.2)^2} \\\\\n&= 1.0\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\nFor the three cases, the interpoint Euclidean distance matrix is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd_{\\rm Euc} =\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{ccc}\n0.0  ~&     &   \\\\\n1.0 ~&  0.0 ~  &  \\\\\n6.3 ~& 5.5 ~&  0.0 ~ \\\\\n\\end{array} \\right]\n\\begin{array}{r}\na_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align*}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nx <- tibble::tibble(V1 = c(7.3, 7.4, 4.1),\n                    V2 = c(7.6, 7.2, 4.6),\n                    V3 = c(7.7, 7.3, 4.6),\n                    V4 = c(8.0, 7.2, 4.8),\n                    point = factor(c(\"a1\", \"a2\", \"a3\")))\nlibrary(GGally)\nlibrary(colorspace)\nlibrary(gridExtra)\npscat <- ggpairs(x, columns=1:4,\n                 upper=list(continuous=\"points\"),\n                 diag=list(continuous=\"blankDiag\"),\n                 axisLabels=\"internal\",\n                 ggplot2::aes(colour=point)) +\n    scale_colour_discrete_qualitative(\n      palette = \"Dark 3\") +\n    theme(aspect.ratio=1)\npscat\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nppar <- ggparcoord(x, columns=1:4, \n                   groupColumn = 5, \n                   scale = \"globalminmax\") +\n          scale_colour_discrete_qualitative(\n            palette = \"Dark 3\") +\n  xlab(\"\") + ylab(\"\") + \n  theme(axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.y = element_blank(),\n        legend.title = element_blank())\nppar\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The scatterplot matrix (left) shows that cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) have similar values. The parallel coordinate plot (right) allows a comparison of other structure, which shows the similarity in the trend of the profiles on cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_3\\).\n\n\nCases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) are more similar to each other than they are to case \\(a_3\\), because the Euclidean distance between cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_2\\) is much smaller than the distance between cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_3\\) and between cases \\(a_2\\) and \\(a_3\\).\nThere are many different ways to calculate similarity. Similarity measures based on correlation distance have become common. Correlation distance is typically used where similarity of structure is more important than similarity in magnitude.\n\nAs an example, see the parallel coordinate plot of the sample data at the right of Figure 2. Cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_3\\) are widely separated, but their shapes are similar (low, medium, medium, high). Case \\(a_2\\), although overlapping with Case \\(a_1\\), has a very different shape (high, medium, medium, low). The correlation between two cases is defined as\n\\[\\begin{align*}\n\\rho(a_i,a_j) = \\frac{(a_i-c_i)'(a_j-c_j)}\n{\\sqrt{(a_i-c_i)'(a_i-c_i)} \\sqrt{(a_j-c_j)'(a_j-c_j)}}\n\\label{corc}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nWhen \\(c_i, c_j\\) are the sample means \\(\\bar{a}_i,\\bar{a}_j\\), then \\(\\rho\\) is the Pearson correlation coefficient. If, indeed, they are set at 0, as is commonly done, \\(\\rho\\) is a generalized correlation that describes the angle between the two data vectors. The correlation is then converted to a distance metric; one equation for doing so is as follows:\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd_{\\rm Cor}(a_i,a_j) = \\sqrt{2(1-\\rho(a_i,a_j))}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nThe above distance metric will treat cases that are strongly negatively correlated as the most distant.\nThe interpoint distance matrix for the sample data using \\(d_{\\rm Cor}\\) and the Pearson correlation coefficient is\n\\[\\begin{align*}\nd_{\\rm Cor} =\n\\left[ \\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrr}\n0.0  ~&     &  \\\\\n3.6 ~ & 0.0 ~ &  \\\\\n0.1 ~ & 3.8 ~ &  0.0 ~\\\\\n\\end{array} \\right]\n\\begin{array}{r}\na_1 \\\\ a_2 \\\\ a_3 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\end{align*}\\]\nBy this metric, cases \\(a_1\\) and \\(a_3\\) are the most similar, because the correlation distance is smaller between these two cases than the other pairs of cases. \nNote that these interpoint distances differ dramatically from those for Euclidean distance. As a consequence, the way the cases would be clustered is also be very different. Choosing the appropriate distance measure is an important part of a cluster analysis.\nAfter a distance metric has been chosen and a cluster analysis has been performed, the analyst must evaluate the results, and this is actually a difficult task. A cluster analysis does not generate \\(p\\)-values or other numerical criteria, and the process tends to produce hypotheses rather than testing them. Even the most determined attempts to produce the “best” results using modeling and validation techniques may result in clusters that, although seemingly significant, are useless for practical purposes. As a result, cluster analysis is best thought of as an exploratory technique, and it can be quite useful despite the lack of formal validation because of its power in data simplification.\nThe context in which the data arises is the key to assessing the results. If the clusters can be characterized in a sensible manner, and they increase our knowledge of the data, then we are on the right track. To use an even more pragmatic criterion, if a company can gain an economic advantage by using a particular clustering method to carve up their customer database, then that is the method they should use.\n\n\n\n\n\nBoehmke, B., and B.

    "text": "9.1 Explanation of the algorithm\nHierarchical cluster algorithms sequentially fuse neighboring points to form ever-larger clusters, starting from a full interpoint distance matrix. Figure 9.1 illustrates the hierarchical clustering approach for a simple simulated data set (a) with two well-separated clusters in 2D. The dendrogram (b) is a representation of the order that points are joined into clusters. The dendrogram strongly indicates two clusters because there are two branches branches representing the last join are much longer than all of the other branches. Although, the dendrogram is usually a good summary of the steps taken by the algorithm, it can be misleading. The dendrogram might strongly suggest a clustering but it might be a terrible solution. To check this we need to show the model with the data, as shown in plot (c). The segments show how the points and clusters are joined. Note that once points are joined into a cluster, the centroid of that cluster is used as the join location with other points or other clusters, and this is represented by a “+”. We can see that the longest edge is the one stretching across the gap between the two clusters, which is the location where the dendrogram would be cut to produce the two-cluster solution. This two-cluster solution is shown in plot (d).\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(mulgar)\nlibrary(ggdendro)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(patchwork)\nlibrary(tourr)\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(htmlwidgets)\n#library(RColorBrewer)\nlibrary(colorspace)\nlibrary(GGally)\n\n\n\n\nCode\ndata(simple_clusters)\n# Data has two well-separated clusters\npd <- ggplot(simple_clusters, aes(x=x1, y=x2)) +\n  geom_point(colour=\"orange\", size=2, alpha=0.8) +\n  ggtitle(\"(a)\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1) \n\n# Compute hierarchical clustering with Ward's linkage\ncl_hw <- hclust(dist(simple_clusters[,1:2]),\n                method=\"ward.D2\")\ncl_ggd <- dendro_data(cl_hw, type = \"triangle\")\nph <- ggplot() +\n  geom_segment(data=cl_ggd$segments, \n               aes(x = x, y = y, \n                   xend = xend, yend = yend)) + \n  geom_point(data=cl_ggd$labels, aes(x=x, y=y),\n             colour=\"orange\", alpha=0.8) +\n  ggtitle(\"(b)\") +\n  theme_dendro()\n\n# Compute dendrogram in data\ncl_hfly <- hierfly(simple_clusters, cl_hw, scale=FALSE)\n\npdh <- ggplot() +\n  geom_segment(data=cl_hfly$segments, \n                aes(x=x, xend=xend,\n                    y=y, yend=yend)) +\n  geom_point(data=cl_hfly$data, \n             aes(x=x1, y=x2,\n                 shape=factor(node),\n                 colour=factor(node),\n                 size=1-node), alpha=0.8) +\n  scale_shape_manual(values = c(16, 3)) +\n  scale_colour_manual(values = c(\"orange\", \"black\")) +\n  scale_size(limits=c(0,17)) +\n  ggtitle(\"(c)\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1, legend.position=\"none\")\n\n# Show result\nsimple_clusters <- simple_clusters %>%\n  mutate(clw = factor(cutree(cl_hw, 2)))\npc <- ggplot(simple_clusters) +\n  geom_point(aes(x=x1, y=x2, colour=clw), \n             size=2, alpha=0.8) +\n  scale_colour_discrete_qualitative(palette = \"Dark 3\") +\n  ggtitle(\"(d)\") +\n  theme(aspect.ratio=1, legend.position=\"none\")\n\npd + ph + pdh + pc + plot_layout(ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Hierarchical clustering on simulated data: (a) data, (b) dendrogram, (c) dendrogram on the data, and (d) two cluster solution. Nodes of the dendrogram indicated by + when it is drawn on the data.\n\n\n\n\nClustering algorithms are all prone to being confused by different problems occurring in data. For hierarchical clustering, plotting the dendrogram on the data provides another way to assess the solution. For hierarchical clustering additional the complications arise from a range of choices for defining distance once points have been joined into clusters.\nDistance between clusters is described by a “linkage method”, of which there are many. For example, single linkage measures the distance between clusters by the smallest interpoint distance between the members of the two clusters clusters, complete linkage uses the maximum interpoint distance, and average linkage uses the average of the interpoint distances. Wards linkage, which usually produces the best clustering solutions, defines the distance as the reduction in the within-group variance. A good discussion on cluster analysis and linkage can be found in Boehmke and Greenwell (2019), on Wikipedia or any multivariate textbook."

These are descriptions of the shape of the variance-covariance for a multivariate normal distribution. A standard multivariate normal distribution has a variance-covariance matrix with zeros in the off-diagonal elements, which corresponds to spherically shaped data. When the variances (diagonals) are different or the variables are correlated, then the shape of data from a multivariate normal is ellipsoidal.\n\nThe models are typically scored using the Bayes Information Criterion (BIC), which is based on the log likelihood, number of variables, and number of mixture components. They should also be assessed using graphical methods, as we demonstrate using the data."

    "title": "12  Self-organizing maps",
    "section": "",
    "text": "A self-organizing map (SOM) is constructed using a constrained \\(k\\)-means algorithm. A 1D or 2D net is stretched through the data. The knots, in the net, form the cluster means, and the points closest to the knot are considered to belong to that cluster. The similarity of nodes (and their corresponding clusters) is defined as proportional to their distance from one another on the net.\nWe will demonstrate SOM using the music data. The data has 62 cases, each one corresponding to a piece of music. For each piece there are seven variables: the artist, the type of music, and five characteristics, based on amplitude and frequency, that were computed using the first 40 seconds of the piece on CD. The music used included popular rock songs by Abba, the Beatles, and the Eels; classical compositions by Vivaldi, Mozart and Beethoven; and several new wave pieces by Enya. Figure~\\(\\ref{music-som}\\) displays a typical view of the results of clustering using SOM on the music data. Each data point corresponds to a piece of music and is labeled by the band or the composer. The map was generated by this R code:\n> library(som)\n> d.music <- read.csv(\"music-sub.csv\", row.names=1)\n> d.music.std <- cbind(subset(d.music.std,\n   select=c(artist,type)),\n   apply(subset(d.music.std,select=lvar:lfreq), \n   2, f.std.data))\n> music.som <- som(subset(d.music.std,select=lvar:lfreq), \n   6, 6, neigh=\"bubble\", rlen=1000)\nThe left plot in ?fig-music-som is called the 2D map view. Here we have used a \\(6\\times 6\\) net pulled through the 5D data. The net that was wrapped through the high-dimensional space is straightened and laid out flat, and the points, like fish in a fishing net, are laid out where they have been trapped. In the plot shown here, the points have been jittered slightly, away from the knots of the net, so that the labels do not overlap too much. If the fit is good, the points that are close together in this 2D map view are close together in the high-dimensional data space and close to the net as it was placed in the high-dimensional space.\nMuch of the structure in the map is no surprise: The rock (purple) and classical tracks (green) are on opposing corners, with rock in the upper right and classical in the lower left. The Abba tracks are all grouped at the top and left of the map. The Beatles and Eels tracks are mixed. There are some unexpected associations: For example, one Beatles song, which turns out to be “Hey Jude”, is mixed among the classical compositions!\n\nConstruction of a self-organizing map is a dimension reduction method, akin to multidimensional scaling Borg and Groenen (2005) or principal component analysis Johnson and Wichern (2002). Using principal component analysis to find a low-dimensional approximation of the similarity between music pieces, yields the second plot in ?fig-music-som. There are many differences between the two representations. The SOM has a more even spread of music pieces across the grid, in contrast to the stronger clumping of points in the PCA view. Indeed, the PCA view shows several outliers, notably one of the Vivaldi compositions, which could lead us to learn things about the data that we might miss by relying exclusively on the SOM. \nThese two methods, SOM and PCA, have provided two contradictory clustering models. How can we determine which is the more accurate description of the data structure? An important part of model assessment is plotting the model in relation to the data. Although plotting the low-dimensional map is the common way to graphically assess the SOM results, it is woefully limited. If a model has flaws, they may not show up in this view and will only appear in plots of the model in the data space. We will use the grand tour to create these plots, and this will help us assess the two models.\nWe will use a grand tour to view the net wrapped in among the data, hoping to learn how the net converged to this solution, and how it wrapped through the data space. Actually, it is rather tricky to fit a SOM: Like many algorithms, it has a number of parameters and initialization conditions that affect the outcome.\nTo set up the data, we will need to add variables containing the map coordinates to the data:\n> d.music.som <- f.ggobi.som(subset(d.music.std,\n   select=lvar:lfreq), music.som)\nBecause this data has several useful categorical labels for each row, we will want to keep this information in the data when it is loaded into the tour:\n> d.music.som <- data.frame(\n  Songs=factor(c(as.character(row.names(d.music)),\n    rep(\"0\",36))),\n  artist=factor(c(as.character(d.music[,1]),rep(\"0\",36))),\n  type=factor(c(as.character(d.music[,2]),rep(\"0\",36))),\n  lvar=d.music.som[,1], \n  lave=d.music.som[,2], \n  lmax=d.music.som[,3],\n  lfener=d.music.som[,4], lfreq=d.music.som[,5],\n  Map.1=d.music.som[,6], Map.2=d.music.som[,7])\n> gd <- ggobi(d.music.som)[1]\nAdd the edges that form the SOM net:\n> d.music.som.net <- f.ggobi.som.net(music.som)\n> edges(gd) <- d.music.som.net + 62\nAnd finally color the points according to the type of music:\n> gcolor <- rep(8,98)\n> gcolor[d.music.som$Type==\"Rock\"] <- 6\n> gcolor[d.music.som$Type==\"Classical\"] <- 4\n> gcolor[d.music.som$Type==\"New wave\"] <- 1\n> glyph_color(g) <- gcolor\nThe results can be seen in ?fig-clust-SOMa and ?fig-clust-SOMb. The plots show two different states of the fitting process and of the SOM net cast through the data. In both fits, a \\(6\\times 6\\) grid is used and the net is initialized in the direction of the first two principal components. In both fits the variables were standardized to have mean equal to zero and standard deviation equal to 1. The first SOM fit, shown in ?fig-clust-SOMa, was obtained using the default settings; it gave terrible results. At the left is the map view, in which the fit looks deceptively reasonable. The points are spread evenly through the grid, with rock tracks (purple) at the upper right, classical tracks (green) at the lower left, and new wave tracks (the three black rectangles) in between. The tour view in the same figure, however, shows the fit to be inadequate. The net is a flat rectangle in the 5D space and has not sufficiently wrapped through the data. This is the result of stopping the algorithm too soon, thus failing to let it converge fully.\n\n?fig-clust-SOMb shows our favorite fit to the data. The data was standardized, we used a 6$$6 net, and we ran the SOM algorithm for 1,000 iterations. The map is at the top left, and it matches the map already shown in ?fig-music-som, except for the small jittering of points in the earlier figure. The other three plots show different projections from the grand tour. The upper right plot shows how the net curves with the nonlinear dependency in the data: The net is warped in some directions to fit the variance pattern. At the bottom right we see that one side of the net collects a long separated cluster of the Abba tracks. We can also see that the net has not been stretched out to the full extent of the range of the data. It is tempting to manually manipulate the net to stretch it in different directions and update the fit.\nIt turns out that the PCA view of the data more accurately reflects the structure in the data than the map view. The music pieces really are clumped together in the 5D space, and there are a few outliers. \n\n\n\n\nBorg, I., and P. J. F. Groenen. 2005. Modern Multidimensional Scaling.

When the clustering is the result of an algorithm, a very useful first step is to paint the points by cluster membership and to look at the data to see whether the clustering seems sensible. How many clusters are there, and how big are they? What shape are they, and do they overlap one another? Which variables have contributed most to the clustering? Can the clusters be qualitatively described? All the plots we have described can be useful: scatterplots, parallel coordinate plots, and area plots, as well as static plots like dendrograms.\nWhen the clusters have been generated by a model, we should also use graphics to help us assess the model. If the model makes distributional assumptions, we can generate ellipses and compare them with the clusters to see whether the shapes are consistent. For self-organizing maps the tour can assist in uncovering problems with the fit, such as when the map wraps in on itself through the data making it appear that some cases are far apart when they are truly close together. A confusion table can come alive with linked brushing, so that mismatches and agreements between methods can be explored. \n\n\n\n\nDasu, T., D. F. Swayne, and D.

One also might be tempted to cluster the players, but there are no obvious clusters so it could be frustrating. At best one could partition the players into groups, while recognising there are no absolutely distinct and separated groups.\n\n\nSource\nSee the information provided with the fitzRoy package.\n\n\nPre-processing\nThe code for downloading and pre-processing the data is available at the mulgar website in the data-raw folder. The data provided by the fitzRoy package was pre-processed to reduce the variables to only those that relate to player skills and performance. It is possible that using some transformations on the variables would be useful to make them less skewed."

The hotspots data was collected from P-Tree System (2020), climate data was taken from the Australian Bureau of Meteorology using the bomrang package (Sparks et al. 2020), wind data from McVicar (2011) and Iowa State University (2020), vegetation data from Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (2018), distance from roads calculated using OpenStreetMap contributors (2020), CFA stations from Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (2020a), and campsites from Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (2020b). The cause was predicted from training data provided by Department of Environment, Land, Water & Planning (2019).\n\n\nPre-processing\nThe 60 variables are too many to view with a tour, so it should be pre-processed using principal component analysis. The categorical variables of FOR_TYPE and FOR_CAT are removed. It would be possible to keep these if they are converted to dummy (binary variables)."

I have tried to give a mix of things on a variety of topics. It would be nice to see if there’s updated versions of the “tips” (there seems to be a lot of noise in the literature here and no open datasets) and Di’s music data (perhaps we could scrape our own spotify accounts to get an equivalent), there are also a few audio challenge datasets like FSD50K .
