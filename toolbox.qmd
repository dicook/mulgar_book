## Using tours in the `tourr` package

### Installation

You can install the released version of `tourr` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tourr")
```

and the development version from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ggobi/tourr")
```

- install
- starting a tour

### Getting started

To run a tour in R, use one of the animate functions. This code will show a 2D tour displayed as a scatterplot on a 6D data set with three labelled classes. 

``` r
animate_xy(flea[,-7], col=flea$species)
```

@tourr remains a good reference for learning more about this package.

### Different tours

SHOULD SOME OF THIS GO IN INTRO??

Working with many dimensions, how to adapt 

Grand tour, and show paths on the space, starting with 1D. How more time gives more coverage of the sphere. Then the torus and paths on torus.

Different types of tours, and when to use them.

And finally how to save tours, and make plot of single projection

Need to include
- half_range
- standardizing variables

## What not to do

Explain data needed for input, what happens if discrete data is included, or time series 

## Tours in other software

Also include other software now available

- detourr
- langevitour
- woylier
- spinifex
