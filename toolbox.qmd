## Using tours in the `tourr` package

### Installation

You can install the released version of `tourr` from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("tourr")
```

and the development version from github with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("ggobi/tourr")
```

### Getting started

To run a tour in R, use one of the animate functions. This code will show a 2D tour displayed as a scatterplot on a 6D data set with three labelled classes. 

``` r
animate_xy(flea[,-7], col=flea$species)
```

@tourr remains a good reference for learning more about this package.

### Different tours

There are two main components of the tour algorithm:

1. The dimension of the projection, which will impact the type of display to use.
2. The algorithm that delivers the projections to show. 

#### Dimension of projection and display

- `display_dist()`: choice of density, histogram or average shifted histogram (ash) display of the 1D projections.
- `display_xy()`, `display_density2d()`, `display_groupxy()`, `display_pca()`, `display_sage()`, `display_slice()`, `display_trails()`: choices in display of 2D projections.
- `display_depth()`, `display_stereo()`: choices to display 3D projections. 

#### Algorithms for projection delivery

- grand:
- guided:
- little:

### Saving your tour

Working with many dimensions, how to adapt 

Grand tour, and show paths on the space, starting with 1D. How more time gives more coverage of the sphere. Then the torus and paths on torus.

Different types of tours, and when to use them.

And finally how to save tours, and make plot of single projection

Need to include
- half_range
- standardizing variables

### Understanding your tour path

## What not to do

Explain data needed for input, what happens if discrete data is included, or time series 

## Tours in other software

Also include other software now available

- detourr
- langevitour
- woylier
- spinifex
- ferrn
