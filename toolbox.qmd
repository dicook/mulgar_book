Description and explanation of primary methods used throughout the book. Mostly focusing on tour methods.

We need a really nice friendly introduction to tour methods:

- 2D to 1D projections as basic explanation
- maybe 3D to 2D, or even 4D to 2D illustration

Show examples of what can be gained from looking at combinations as opposed to pairs plots, for example. Clusters is a good situation, but also collinearity and outliers

Explain data needed for input, what happens if discrete data is included, or time series 

Working with many dimensions, how to adapt 

Grand tour, and show paths on the space, starting with 1D. How more time gives more coverage of the sphere. Then the torus and paths on torus.

Different types of tours, and when to use them.

And finally how to save tours, and make plot of single projection

Need to include
- half_range
- standardizing variables

Also include other software now available
