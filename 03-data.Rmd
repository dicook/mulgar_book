# Data {#data}


This chapter describes the datasets used throughout the book, one possibility
is that this could be moved to an appendix and in the online version of the
book any mention of the dataset in the main text
could be cross-linked to its description. One
thing that I really liked in the first edition is the emphasis on analysis
question of interest and the little notes about the data. I believe the
original layout was to put the data in order of appearance of the book, which
naturally clusters them by technique.

There were fifteen datasets listed in chapter 7 of the first edition. Several
of these were related to networks which we are not including this time. I have
tried to give a mix of things on a variety of topics. It would be nice to
see if there's updated versions of the "tips" and Di's music data. I think
it would be useful to have more unstructured data sets like tweets or books.
