# Introduction {#intro}

High-dimensional data means that we have a large number of numeric features or variables, which can be considered as dimensions in a mathematical space. The variables can be different types, such as categorical or temporal, but the handling of these variables involves different techniques. 

![Viewing high dimensions using low-dimensional displays is like playing shadow puppets, looking at the shadows to guess what the shape is.](images/shadow-puppets.png){#fig-shadow-puppets}

## Notation conventions and R objects

The data can be considered to be a matrix of numbers with the columns corresponding to variables, and the rows correspond to observations. It can be helpful to write this in mathematical notation, like:

\begin{eqnarray*}
X_{n\times p} =
[X_1~X_2~\dots~X_p]_{n\times p} = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
X_{11} & X_{12} & \dots & X_{1p} \\
X_{21} & X_{22} & \dots & X_{2p}\\
\vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
X_{n1} & X_{n2} & \dots & X_{np} \end{array} \right]_{n\times p}
\end{eqnarray*}

where $X$ indicates the the $n\times p$ data matrix, $X_j$ indicates variable $j, j=1, \dots, p$ and $X_{ij}$ indicates the value $j^{th}$ variable of the $i^{th}$ observation. (It can be confusing to distinguish whether one is referring to the observation or a variable, because $X_i$ is used to indicate observation also. When this is done it is usally accompanied by qualifying words such as **observation** $X_3$, or **variable** $X_3$.)

When there is a response variable(s), it is common to consider $X$ to be the predictors, and use $Y$ to indicate the response variable(s). $Y$ could be a matrix, also, and would be $n\times q$, where commonly $q=1$. $Y$ could be numeric or categorical, and this would change how it is handled with visualisation.

To make a low-dimensional projection (shadow) of the data, we need a projection matrix:

\begin{eqnarray*}
A_{p\times d} = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
A_{11} & A_{12} & \dots & A_{1d} \\
A_{21} & A_{22} & \dots & A_{2d}\\
\vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
A_{p1} & A_{p2} & \dots & A_{pd} \end{array} \right]_{p\times d}
\end{eqnarray*}


$A$ should be an orthonormal matrix, which means that the $\sum_{j=1}^p A_{jk}^2=1, k=1, \dots, d$ (columns represent vectors of length 1) and $\sum_{j=1}^p A_{jk}A_{jl}=0, k,l=1, \dots, d$ (columns represent vectors that are orthogonal to each other).

Then the projected data is written as:

\begin{eqnarray*}
Y_{n\times d} = XA = \left[ \begin{array}{cccc}
y_{11} & y_{12} & \dots & y_{1d} \\
y_{21} & y_{22} & \dots & y_{2d}\\
\vdots & \vdots &  & \vdots \\
y_{n1} & y_{n2} & \dots & y_{nd} \end{array} \right]_{n\times d}
\end{eqnarray*}

where $y_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^p X_{ik}A_{kj}$. Note that we are using $Y$ as the projected data here, as well as it possibly being used for a response variable. Where necessary, this will be clarified with words in the text, when notation is used in explanations later.

When using R, if we only have the data corresponding to $X$ it makes sense to use a `matrix` object. However, if the response variable is included and it is categorical, then we might use a `data.frame` or a `tibble` which can accommodate non-numerical values. Then to work with the data, we can use the base R methods:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
X <- matrix(c(1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.2, 2.7, 2.6, 2.4, 2.5, 3.5, 3.4, 3.2, 3.6), ncol=4, byrow=TRUE)
X
```

which is a data matrix with $n=3, p=4$ and to extract a column (variable):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
X[,2]
```

or a row (observation):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
X[2,]
```

or an individual cell (value):

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
X[3,2]
```

To make a projection we need an orthonormal matrix:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
A <- matrix(c(0.707,0.707,0,0,0,0,0.707,0.707), ncol=2, byrow=FALSE)
A
```
You can check that it is orthonormal by

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
sum(A[,1]^2)
sum(A[,1]*A[,2])
```

and make a projection using matrix multiplication:

```{r}
#| code-fold: false
X %*% A
```

<!-- Most data arrives with a mix of numerical and categorical, and temporal or spatial variables. In this book we are primarily focused on methods to visualise multiple numerical variables. -->
