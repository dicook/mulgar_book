# Introduction {#intro}

High-dimensional data means that we have a large number of numeric features or variables, which can be considered as dimensions in a mathematical space. The variables can be different types, such as categorical or temporal, but the handling of these variables involves different techniques. 

![Viewing high dimensions using low-dimensional displays is like playing shadow puppets, looking at the shadows to guess what the shape is.](images/shadow-puppets.png){#fig-shadow-puppets}

## Notation conventions and R objects

## What's different about space beyond 2D

- Cubes
-   A lot of Ursula's work like the figures in the burning sage paper could be useful here
-   A good spot to introduce a metaphor for the tour

## Interactive and dynamic graphics literature

A short history of the literature, how does that stat graphics literature differ from info vis?

## An opening case study

To give a taste of the approach used in the book

## The big picture of the book
